<DIV style="position:absolute;top:367;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">We present in this paper the design and an evaluation of a novel <br>interface called the Relation Browser++ (RB++) for searching <br>and browsing large information collections. RB++ provides <br>visualized category overviews of an information space and <br>allows dynamic filtering and exploration of the result set by <br>tightly coupling the browsing and searching functions. A user <br>study was conducted to compare the effectiveness, efficiency <br>and user satisfaction of completing various types of searching <br>and browsing using the RB++ interface and a traditional form-<br>fillin interface for a video library. An exploration set of tasks <br>was also included to examine the effectiveness of and user <br>satisfaction with the RB++ when applied to a large federal <br>statistics website. The comparison study strongly supported that <br>RB++ was more effective, efficient, and satisfying for <br>completing data exploration tasks.  Based on the results, efforts <br>to automatically populate the underlying database using machine <br>learning techniques are underway.  Preliminary implementations <br>for two large-scale federal statistical websites have been <br>installed on government servers for internal evaluation. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:362;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>1. INTRODUCTION </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:392;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">The size and breadth of large government websites and digital <br>libraries makes it difficult for people to quickly grasp what <br>content is and is not available. Dynamic overviews and previews <br>of collections can help people decide if it is worthwhile to look <br>further [8].  As they do look further, it is helpful for their <br>searching and browsing to quickly see partitions of the <br>collection and how many items are available in different <br>partitions. We believe that government website users will be <br>well-served by highly interactive user interfaces that support <br>alternative views of the collections, partitions, and results sets.  <br>This paper describes a user interface that aims to provide agile <br>control for browse and search, reports results from a user study <br>comparing this interface to a typical WWW search interface, and <br>describes the ongoing evolution of the interface, including <br>efforts to automate discovery of topical categories and <br>assignment of webpages to those categories.   </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:649;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">Faceted category structure is one way to help people understand <br>the composition of an information collection. A faceted <br>approach provides different ways to slice and dice the <br>information space, which allows people to look at the <br>information space from different perspectives. Allowing people <br>to explore the relationships among different facets may further <br>deepen their understanding and support new insights. The <br>relation browser (RB) is an interface which provides an <br>overview of the collection by displaying different categories and <br>enables people to explore the relationships among these <br>categories [13]. The different facet values also serve as <br>selectable objects that may be employed as query widgets for a <br>search so that the entire space can quickly be partitioned with <br>simple mouse moves and with consequent immediate display of <br>the resulting partition in the results panel. Figure 1 shows the <br>mock-up interface of an early version of the relation browser in <br>the domain of U.S. federal statistics websites. The web pages in <br>the site were sliced into four different facets: by topic, data type, <br>region, and date. The numbers beside the bars indicate the <br>number of websites associated with the attributes. By mousing <br>over any of the topics, the distribution of the specific topics in <br>other facets are visualized as graphic bars.  The underlying data <br>for this instance of the interface was manually extracted from a <br>small set of 200 webpages contained in more than 70 federal <br>statistical agency websites. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:460;left:163"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>Figure 1. Relation Browser (RB) </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:484;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">This early version of the RB has been redesigned based on user <br>studies and experience applying the interface to more than a <br>dozen different database instances [13]. The new version is <br>called RB++, which improves the RB significantly in several <br>ways (see Figure 2) [23,24]. First, RB++ displays multiple <br>facets (categories) visually and on the same screen rather than <br>only two facets with tab options to others. The multiple facets <br>provide an overview of the information space. The facet values <br>are visually represented by graphic bars with different lengths, <br>which indicate the number of items associated with them. <br>Second, RB++ allows more flexibility to explore relationships. <br>One of the features of RB++ is that you can restrict the <br>information items (partition the information space) by mousing <br>over any bars and other bars are proportionally highlighted to <br>show the conditional distribution across all the facets. Note that <br>the previous RB was limited to visualizing pairwise <br>relationships with one main facet. Third, the RB++ added a <br>dynamic filtering function for the result set (see Figure 3). Once <br>the search results are displayed in the table, further filtering can <br>be done by typing in keywords (string patterns) in the boxes <br>located immediately above the result fields. The filtering is <br>dynamic, which means that with each character typed in or <br>removed from the boxes, RB++ matches the string patterns in <br>the boxes with the corresponding field of the results. Only the <br>matched results are then displayed immediately in the results <br>panel and the matched string in the results is highlighted. This <br>dynamic feature gives users instant and constant feedback about <br>the filtered results and how many items they will get with <br>different keywords, which allows users to try out different <br>filtering keywords very easily and efficiently. Fourth, the RB++ <br>provides an overview of the results set and tightly couples the <br>overview and results set panels. The overview panel is <br>dynamically updated to give users a contextualized overview of <br>the updated result set. These new features give users more <br>power to understand and explore the information collection and <br>give them a flexible and rapid way to find the information they <br>want.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:148;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">In the paper, we argue that the RB++ interface will bring users <br>added values beyond simple searching and browsing by in fact <br>combining these search strategies seamlessly. In the next <br>section, the methodology of a user study is described. The <br>results of the user study are then presented and discussed. <br>Limitations of the interface and current efforts to deal with data <br>classification are then described. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:937;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">The purpose of the user study was two-fold: first, we wanted to <br>compare the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction <br>associated with completing certain tasks using RB++ against <br>that obtained by the traditional form-fillin search interface <br>(baseline interface). Second, we wanted to explore if the RB++ <br>interface would lead to new interaction patterns with the <br>interface and if so, to determine what these new interaction <br>patterns might be. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">Seventeen undergraduate and graduate students were recruited <br>from the UNC-Chapel Hill campus for this study. They came <br>from various schools and departments. There were 10 females <br>and 7 males with an age range from 19 to 44, (15 were in their <br>20s, and all were familiar with www browsers. The participants <br>were given $15 for their participation. The data from the first <br>two participants was used as a pilot test; based on which the <br>experimental protocol and instruments were revised. The data <br>from the other 15 participants was used for the data analysis. <br>The study proceeded in two phases, a within subjects <br>comparison across two different interfaces for the same <br>database, and an exploratory investigation with a single <br>government statistical website instance of RB++.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:319;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft15"><b>2.1 Phase One: RB++ to Baseline <br>Comparison for a Film Database </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:369;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">The first phase was a comparison study in which participants <br>used both the RB++ interface and the baseline interface. The <br>order of using these interfaces was counter balanced. The <br>domain of the information items in both interfaces was the video <br>collection in the UNC-CH library <br>(http://www.lib.unc.edu/house/mrc/index.html?page=filmograph<br>y) that contains about 10000 films. The library online video <br>search interface (Filmfinder) was used as our baseline interface. <br>FilmFinder is a fairly typical www form-fillin search interface <br>(see Figure 4 and Figure 5), where users can specify queries <br>within fields such as title, release year, director, description, <br>genre, origin, and format.  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:387;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">All participants were run individually in sessions ranging from <br>60-90 minutes and all sessions were video taped. The protocol <br>for the first phase was as follows: First, a demographic pre-test <br>questionnaire was completed. Second, the participant was <br>trained for the first interface assigned in their condition. The <br>training consisted of: an introduction to the features of the <br>interface, a demo of each type of task with the interface, and <br>participant practice using the interface until s/he was <br>comfortable with it.  Third, the participant used the interface to <br>complete 10 search tasks. Tasks were assigned to participants <br>one by one by handing them pieces of paper for each task.   A <br>timer was used to count time used to complete each task except <br>for task 10 (see description of task 10 below). After each task, a <br>short satisfaction questionnaire was completed by the <br>participant. Fourth, a usability questionnaire was filled out after <br>the participant finished using the first interface.  Next, the <br>participant was trained for the second interface and the same <br>procedures were used to complete 10 more search tasks.  <br>Finally, an open-ended questionnaire about perceived <br>differences and preferences for the two interfaces was <br>completed. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:722;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">The tasks were classified into three different types: 1. Simple <br>look up task. Tasks 1 to 3 in each task set were of this type. For <br>example, "Check if the movie titled "The Matrix" is in the <br>library movie collection." 2. Data exploration and analysis tasks. <br>Tasks 4 to 9 in each task set were of this type. This kind of task <br>requires users to understand and make sense of the information <br>collection, which could be a starting point for them to further <br>their searching or browsing. Two examples of this type are: "In <br>which decade did "Steven Spielberg" direct the most movies?"; <br>and "How many movie titles does the library hold that were <br>released in the year 2000?" 3. Task 10 was a free exploration <br>task, which asked participants to find five favorite videos <br>without any time constraints. The tasks assigned for the two <br>interfaces were different but comparable. For example, the <br>comparable tasks for two interfaces simply substituted different <br>video titles or directors. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>2.3 Modeling User Interaction </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:138;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">To help us form hypotheses and analyze and make sense of the <br>experimental data, we employed a linguistic model, called BNF <br>grammar, to model the user's interaction with the interface. BNF <br>grammar was originally used by Reisner to describe the dialog <br>grammar of an interactive graphics system [15], where the user's <br>interaction with a system was seen as an action language and <br>BNF grammar was used to formally describe the language. The <br>BNF grammar consists of a set of rules which define higher <br>level user behaviors in terms of lower level ones. Each rule can <br>be composed of terminals, non-terminals, and a set of symbols. <br>Terminals usually represent the lowest level of user behavior, <br>such as pressing a key or clicking a mouse button and can not be <br>further defined. Non-terminals represent a high level abstraction <br>and can be defined in terms of other non-terminals and <br>terminals. Terminals are written with upper case letters and non-<br>terminals are written with lower case letters. The "::=" symbol is <br>read as " is defined as". The "+", "|" and "-" symbols are used at <br>the right hand side of rules to connect, respectively, sequence of <br>user behavior, set of options, and concurrent user behaviors. <br>With the BNF grammar, we can describe the user's interaction <br>with the RB++ as follows: </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:315;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">The number of rules and options within rules reflects the <br>interactive nature and number of alternative choices provided by <br>these two interfaces.  Note that we used the terminals such as <br>CLICK SEARCH BUTTON and CLICK VISUAL BAR which <br>strictly speaking are not the lowest level of user behaviors, <br>however, using higher level abstraction as terminals is suitable <br>for interactive display-based systems [4] and ensures later data <br>analysis. Many rules are defined recursively and consist of <br>several options, which essentially reflect the interactivity of the <br>graphical user interface (GUI). For example, a fairly interactive <br>user behavior in RB++, "browse results (A6)", consists of either <br>`OBSERVE RESULTS', `CLICK RESULT ITEM', `CLICK <br>SORTING BUTTON', explore results, or any combination of <br>the above. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:541;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">From the BNF definition, we can see that RB++ is a more <br>interactive interface than the baseline because it involves more <br>rules and recursive definitions. However, it is not necessarily a <br>complicated interface, since the rules for the RB++ interface are <br>largely composed of a set of options instead of a sequence of <br>user behaviors, which means that many rules are not executed <br>for some types of tasks. Based on the BNF grammars, we <br>hypothesize that for the simple search tasks, the RB++ interface <br>will not necessarily be significantly different from the baseline <br>interface, but for complicated searching and browsing tasks, that <br>require more interaction or collection exploration, the RB++ will <br>be significantly more effective, efficient, and satisfying than the <br>baseline. For simple look up type tasks, both interfaces involve <br>the sequence of user actions: formulate query, CLICK SEARCH <br>BUTTON, and navigate results (see rule A1 and B1). <br>Navigation of results is simple for this type of task in that it only <br>involves the judgment of zero or non-zero results, which is <br>trivial in both interfaces. Formulation of the query in this case <br>involves typing in keywords and/or selecting the items from the <br>interfaces (see rule A2, A4 and B2, B3). Even though item <br>selection in the baseline interface involves two clicks (see rule <br>B3) which means a slightly longer time to execute than in <br>RB++, which only needs one click on the visual bar for item <br>selection (see rule A4), we expected no significant difference. <br>For type 2 tasks that involve data exploration and analysis, <br>interaction with the visual bars of the RB++ interface provides <br>an effective and efficient interaction style. Two typical <br>sequences of user behaviors to complete type 2 tasks are: <br>explore the collection by clicking (or mousing over) and <br>observing the visual bars (see rule A1 and A3), or formulate a <br>query and then explore the results by observing the visual bars <br>(see rule A1, A5, A6, A8 and A9). With the traditional interface <br>to finish type 2 tasks, users have to formulate a query and then </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">literally scan and count all the results (see rule B1, B4, B5, and <br>B6), which is time consuming. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:148;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">We also hypothesized that users would exhibit rich interaction <br>during their navigation of the results with RB++ (see rule A5 to <br>A10). Actions of typing in keywords and clicking visual bars to <br>filter results (rule A10) would be used frequently and <br>interchangeably by the users to finish complex search tasks, <br>especially when large numbers of results are returned.  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:435;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">There were also open-ended questions that the participants <br>answered after finishing both interfaces.

Thirteen out of 15 participants <br>indicated that the RB++ interface gave them more confidence to <br>complete the tasks. It was easy to go back and forth and to verify <br>the results and the informative overview panel gave the <br>participants more confidence to finish tasks. There was one <br>participant who thought that both interfaces gave equal <br>confidence and there was one participant who thought that the <br>Filmfinder interface gave more confidence since he was more <br>familiar with the Filmfinder and he felt somewhat confused by <br>the dynamic feature of the RB++, but he acknowledged the <br>usefulness of the dynamic feature in narrowing the results in the <br>results panel.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:739;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">When asked which interface better helped them gain an <br>understanding of the library movie collection, the RB++ <br>interface was chosen by all the participants.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:919;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">For the question on the best thing about the RB++, participants <br>pointed out the visual display of the multiple categories, its cross <br>reference ability, the dynamic matching ability of the searching <br>boxes and the one screen display of the results as opposed to the <br>multiple page display of results in Filmfinder.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:209;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">During the second phase we also asked participants to fill out <br>the satisfaction questionnaires after finishing each task and these <br>ratings were predictably high (all means above 3.5)  More <br>importantly, participants were also required to answer a set of <br>open-ended questions after finishing the second phase. For the <br>first question: "What is your overall impression of this interface <br>for finding the statistical data?" the overall impression was <br>positive. Participants used phrases such as "fairly easy to use", <br>"very helpful in finding the information", "good for quick <br>searching". There were also a couple of negative comments such <br>as: "interface still came up with many results after filtering", <br>"title of the results are not descriptive enough". Only one <br>participant said that he did not like the interface, because of the <br>poor categorization of information items under some categories <br>which made him frustrated.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:451;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">When answering the second question: "Was it helpful to <br>understanding what is available at EIA?" all the participants <br>thought the interface was helpful in that regard, which was <br>largely attributed to the visual display of the categories, which <br>gave them a sense of what the website covered. One participant <br>wished that there were more categories displayed.  The <br>questionnaire also asked if the search boxes were helpful in <br>completing the tasks.  Participants gave high praise to this <br>feature with comments such as "it's great to be taken directly to <br>the page but not to have your results lost", "I like the way it <br>narrows the focus and sort of guides a person to the info <br>sought", "I didn't have to be concerned with performing a <br>complex search that may return a null set-the results reflected <br>my search string instantly".  Two participants also commented <br>that the feature was somewhat limited in use since relevant <br>information may not appear in the title, or description.  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:738;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">The results strongly support that the RB++ interface was more <br>effective and efficient in completing type 2 tasks than the <br>baseline interface and that users felt more confident and satisfied <br>with the RB++ in completing type 2 tasks. The higher <br>effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction gained in the RB++ <br>resulted mainly from two aspects: the visual display of the <br>statistical summary of the information items and the dynamic <br>keyword searching capability in the results panel. The <br>visualization bars helped the users understand relative <br>proportions of items at a glance and use the posting numbers <br>directly, which is much faster than literally counting. If we look <br>at the BNF grammar, completion of type 2 tasks in RB++ only <br>required participants to explore the collection (see first option of <br>rule A1) without submitting queries to the database and then <br>observing and counting returned results, which are necessary <br>steps for the baseline interface to complete the same tasks (see <br>rule B1). </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1011;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">The dynamic search boxes allow users do further filtering based <br>on certain criteria and give users feedback on the filtered results <br>instantly and continuously, which not only encourages the users <br>to use this function, but also improves their efficiency.

Coupling <br>provides users more ways to interact with the system and make <br>the interaction more natural and smooth (see rule A8, A9, A10), <br>which suggests a different interaction style for finding <br>information than traditional search interfaces which tend to <br>require discrete, well-defined turn-taking between the user and <br>system. Traditionally, when users get to the results page, all they <br>can do is browse the results. If they want to refine the results, <br>they have to go back to the search interface, type in the refined <br>keywords, click the search, and browse the new results, which <br>not only interrupts the normal results browsing interaction, but <br>also loses the current result set. RB++ encourages users to get an <br>initial manageable result set and then refine it using one <br>interface window without the need to go back and forth. Instead <br>of displaying a set of static results, RB++ offers an effective and <br>efficient means for users to understand the results by displaying <br>summary statistics bars which give both visual and numeric data <br>(see rule A9), and to explore results by providing ways to <br>dynamically and continuously filter (see rule A10). The result <br>set can be as large as displaying the whole collection, or as small <br>as only one item, which depends on the initial query on the <br>collection. In the second phase study, most of the participants <br>completed their search tasks without doing a second query on <br>the initial interface. The study showed that participants could <br>utilize the initial interface to get an initial result set by selecting <br>relevant categories and then narrow down results and find <br>relevant web pages by exploring the results set. Typing in <br>keywords (or string patterns) in search boxes was found to be <br>the most frequently used means to explore and filter result set. <br>These features were highly appreciated by the participants as <br>seen from their comments. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:779;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>RELATED WORK </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:808;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">Many information access interfaces try to provide a starting <br>point for users by presenting overviews of the collection [9]. <br>Overviews can help users understand the whole collection and <br>select or eliminate sources from consideration. Overviews can <br>direct users to subcollections quickly, where they can explore <br>the details. Usually two types of overviews are employed: <br>category overview and graphic overview. The category approach <br>of Yahoo is a good example for the category overview. The <br>HiBrowse interface for viewing category labels hierarchically <br>based on the facets is another example [14]. A more recent <br>information access interface using the category overview by <br>presenting faceted metadata is the Flamenco interface [21]. The <br>last two interfaces not only present the category labels to the <br>users but also inform the users of the number of documents <br>under each category. However, these interfaces do not allow <br>users to employ simple mouse moves to quickly explore the <br>relationship between different categories (or facets). The </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">Flamenco interface could do this as part of its browsing and <br>searching efforts, but it requires many commitments from users <br>such as clicking the category and waiting. The previous version <br>of the relation browser [13] presented various categories and <br>allowed users to explore the relations by mouse over operation, <br>but the interface only allowed the users to mouse over the main <br>category.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:226;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">The graphic overview is another type of overview, which <br>usually employs various information visualization techniques. <br>Lin [12] used the Kohenen map to visually present a topical <br>overview of the collection. Each block on the map represents a <br>subcollection with similar topics which are labeled by one or <br>two salient words extracted from the subcollection. The <br>adjacency of blocks indicates the topic similarity between <br>subcollections. Wise, et al. [19] developed a three dimensional <br>interface to visually present various topics. Zhang, et al. [25] <br>exacted the key concepts from a collection and visually <br>presented the concepts in a spring-embedded graph. Similar <br>concepts were clustered together and usually represented as <br>subtopics. The graphical overview is visually appealing, but the <br>usability of this kind of interface has yet to be explored. 3-D <br>interfaces are more problematic than 2-D interface in terms of <br>ease of use and learnability. It seems that textual labels of <br>category structure are more understandable than graphical <br>representation.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:514;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">Some research has been conducted on how to present the <br>retrieved results in context. Hearst [10] used clustering <br>techniques to cluster retrieval results on the fly and presented <br>different clusters with labeled words to the users to help them <br>understand of the results. Chen, and Dumais [3] employed <br>classification techniques to categorize retrieved results based on <br>the existing category structure and displayed them in <br>hierarchical categories. Zamir and Etzioni [22] developed an <br>interface that used on-the-fly clustering of metasearch results. <br>These interfaces cluster or categorize the retrieval results on the <br>fly, so scaling is problematic. The RB++ categorizes the <br>collection offline and uses a uniform category structure to <br>present overviews of the collection and the retrieval results. <br>Consequently, RB++ can be scaled up easily.  However, because <br>RB++ depends on the metadata to reside on the client side to <br>achieve its dynamics, it also suffers a different kind of <br>scalability limitation.  To date, we have had good success and <br>response with data sets with tens of thousands of records and a <br>dozen or so facets, however data sets with millions of records <br>and scores of facets are problematic.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:834;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">There also has been some work on fast location of specific <br>information items. Sorting is a prevalent means to help users <br>locate a specific item. However, users still need to visually go <br>through a list of items. The Alphaslider [1] is a visual <br>component to help users quickly locate a known string of items, <br>but it's not very easy to use, especially for novice users. Besides, <br>The Alphaslider can only locate the information items based on <br>the first letter alphabetically. RB++ provides an easy and <br>flexible way to locate the information items by typing in string <br>patterns and the patterns can be matched anywhere in the <br>information items. A similar technique is actually used in some <br>applications such as the address box of Internet Explorer </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">browser, but the patterns are limited to matching from the <br>beginning of the query string.   </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:148;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">Dynamic query was a new type of interface [16] that inspired <br>the original relation browser work. The interface visually <br>displays the information items and provides the visual <br>controlling components to explore the information items by <br>tightly coupling search and visual display of results. RB++ uses <br>this design concept, but instead of providing a visual interface, <br>RB++ employs a more understandable (especially for topical <br>overview) category structure for the information items. <br>Moreover, the search box is a very effective and efficient <br>component for the non categorized attributes of the items, while <br>the visual controlling components such as sliders or check boxes <br>can only be used for controlling categorical attributes of the <br>items. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:359;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">Query preview [18], attribute explorer [17] and other interfaces <br>[11], and [20] provide similar ways to explore the relationships <br>between different facets of the classification. These interfaces <br>worked for structured information such as that found in <br>databases. Of course, all these types of interfaces depend on <br>good underlying categorization of data.  Our long-term goal is to <br>make the interface work for unstructured textual information. <br>The search boxes provided are a first step in this direction, <br>although they are currently limited to search within the fields <br>specified in the results display. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:524;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>6.</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:524;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft15"><b>LIMITATIONS OF RB++ AND <br>ONGOING WORK </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:574;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">One constraint in RB++ is the limited number of categories that <br>can be displayed, which is affected by two factors. One factor is <br>screen real estate. We can partially alleviate the issue of screen <br>real estate by utilizing a Zoomable User Interface (ZUI) to <br>display the categories. We have experimented with integrating <br>the Jazz toolkit [2] into the interface and this provides <br>aproximately a ten-fold increase in the number of facet values <br>that can be supported within each facet, although at the expense <br>of some of the mouseover dynamics since the mouse must now <br>be used for zooming as well as normal hovering. Another factor <br>is size of the memory to hold the client-side distribution counts <br>data, the number of which increases exponentially with <br>increased number of displayed categories. One way to solve the <br>issue is to only calculate part of the distribution counts data, <br>which hopefully are most frequently used during the user's <br>interaction with the interface. Other approaches, such as <br>employing novel data structures were also suggested by Doan, et <br>al. [5]. However, all these solutions have to sacrifice the <br>interactivity of the interface that depends on client-side metadata <br>to support rapid mouse activities. For example, preloading <br>partial distribution counts data for large numbers of categories <br>make some distributional data and visualization unavailable <br>when users try to re-partition the information space by mouse <br>moves.  At present, the best development path seems to be <br>hierarchical partitioning of very large information spaces with <br>multiple RB++ instances that require a new download for each <br>of the cascading subsets. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1002;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft10">Another constraint of RB++ is the limited matching function of <br>the search boxes. The interface currently matches input string <br>patterns to the corresponding result fields on the lexical level. <br>Matching in this level is sufficient in many cases such as <br>matching with fields with numbers or short textual strings such </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:108;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">as titles, but for the fields with more semantic bearing strings <br>such as descriptions of web pages, a more sophisticated match <br>function based on semantics might be needed--perhaps a kind <br>of full-text engine in each text field, although the close coupling <br>with the facet panel will then be in doubt. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:195;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">Currently, the interface provides a uniform category structure <br>for both the entire collection and the retrieved results set. This is <br>good for its consistency. However, for the retrieved result set, a <br>more fine-grained category structure might be better for users to <br>understand it and conduct string searches. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:281;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">Overall, the RB++ represents an example of a highly interactive <br>user interface that offers improved performance and satisfaction <br>for users of large websites and digital libraries.  It can find <br>application as the entry point for a large website or as a way to <br>work with large results sets returned from search engines as long <br>as the data is structured in advance.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:384;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft4"><b>7. WORK ON AUTOMATIC CLUSTERING <br>AND CLASSIFICATION </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:434;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">Over the past few years we have created more than two dozen <br>instances of data sets using RB and RB++, demonstrating its <br>applicability as an interface to many different types of data.  If <br>the data resides in a database, it is possible to map the scheme to <br>the underlying RB++ scheme (see [24] for details on the system <br>architecture) and simply import the data automatically.  For <br>many WWW applications, this is not possible so we have been <br>developing ways to automate facet discovery and webpage <br>assignment to those facets.  The basic approach is to crawl the <br>website(s), create term-document representations and then use <br>machine learning techniques to cluster the webpages and extract <br>candidate labels, use human judgment to select the best labels, <br>and then classify the webpages into those categories using the <br>statistical model produced in the process.  See Efron et al [6,7] <br>for details of the techniques we have applied to date.   </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:676;left:486"><nobr><span class="ft10">To illustrate the current state of development, consider the EIA <br>example used in the study reported here.  The categories <br>displayed on the EIA RB++ instance were originally created <br>manually, which certainly did not scale well to many other large <br>information collections such as various other government <br>statistical web sites. Figure 7 is a screen shot of the RB++ <br>instance for the Bureau of Labor Statistics web site that uses <br>topic facets and webpage assignment that were automatically <br>determined. About 13,000 HTML web pages were crawled from <br>web site and a soft clustering method was then applied to those <br>pages. For each webpage, the statistical model yielded a <br>probability of belonging to every cluster. Thus, every page <br>`belongs' to every cluster at some level of probability. The first <br>topic column contains all the pages with highest probability of <br>belonging to those facet values.  The second column contains all <br>the pages with the second highest probability values for those <br>facet values.  The third and fourth columns are the months and <br>years of page update extracted from web pages themselves--<br>facets that are know to be problematic but used for illustration <br>since our primary emphasis was on topic discovery. The display <br>of two topical columns reflects the underlying characteristic of <br>soft clustering where items can appear in multiple clusters. <br>However, our discussions with BLS staff and demonstrations to <br>other potential users show that this two-column display is <br>confusing. Therefore, only the first topical column was kept in a <br>later version of the RB++ BLS instance (see figure 8). An </span></nobr></DIV>
