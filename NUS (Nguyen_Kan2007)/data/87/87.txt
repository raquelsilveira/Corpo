Evaluation and Evolution of a Browse and Search Interface: Relation Browser++
ABSTRACT
We present in this paper the design and an evaluation of a novel 
interface called the Relation Browser++ (RB++) for searching 
and browsing large information collections. RB++ provides 
visualized category overviews of an information space and 
allows dynamic filtering and exploration of the result set by 
tightly coupling the browsing and searching functions. A user 
study was conducted to compare the effectiveness, efficiency 
and user satisfaction of completing various types of searching 
and browsing using the RB++ interface and a traditional form-fillin
interface for a video library. An exploration set of tasks 
was also included to examine the effectiveness of and user 
satisfaction with the RB++ when applied to a large federal 
statistics website. The comparison study strongly supported that 
RB++ was more effective, efficient, and satisfying for 
completing data exploration tasks.  Based on the results, efforts 
to automatically populate the underlying database using machine 
learning techniques are underway.  Preliminary implementations 
for two large-scale federal statistical websites have been 
installed on government servers for internal evaluation.

INTRODUCTION
The size and breadth of large government websites and digital 
libraries makes it difficult for people to quickly grasp what 
content is and is not available. Dynamic overviews and previews 
of collections can help people decide if it is worthwhile to look 
further [8].  As they do look further, it is helpful for their 
searching and browsing to quickly see partitions of the 
collection and how many items are available in different 
partitions. We believe that government website users will be 
well-served by highly interactive user interfaces that support 
alternative views of the collections, partitions, and results sets.  
This paper describes a user interface that aims to provide agile 
control for browse and search, reports results from a user study 
comparing this interface to a typical WWW search interface, and 
describes the ongoing evolution of the interface, including 
efforts to automate discovery of topical categories and 
assignment of webpages to those categories.
Faceted category structure is one way to help people understand 
the composition of an information collection. A faceted 
approach provides different ways to slice and dice the 
information space, which allows people to look at the 
information space from different perspectives. Allowing people 
to explore the relationships among different facets may further 
deepen their understanding and support new insights. The 
relation browser (RB) is an interface which provides an 
overview of the collection by displaying different categories and 
enables people to explore the relationships among these 
categories [13]. The different facet values also serve as 
selectable objects that may be employed as query widgets for a 
search so that the entire space can quickly be partitioned with 
simple mouse moves and with consequent immediate display of 
the resulting partition in the results panel. Figure 1 shows the 
mock-up interface of an early version of the relation browser in 
the domain of U.S. federal statistics websites. The web pages in 
the site were sliced into four different facets: by topic, data type, 
region, and date. The numbers beside the bars indicate the 
number of websites associated with the attributes. By mousing 
over any of the topics, the distribution of the specific topics in 
other facets are visualized as graphic bars.  The underlying data 
for this instance of the interface was manually extracted from a 
small set of 200 webpages contained in more than 70 federal 
statistical agency websites.

Figure 1. Relation Browser (RB)
This early version of the RB has been redesigned based on user 
studies and experience applying the interface to more than a 
dozen different database instances [13]. The new version is 
called RB++, which improves the RB significantly in several 
ways (see Figure 2) [23,24]. First, RB++ displays multiple 
facets (categories) visually and on the same screen rather than 
only two facets with tab options to others. The multiple facets 
provide an overview of the information space. The facet values 
are visually represented by graphic bars with different lengths, 
which indicate the number of items associated with them. 
Second, RB++ allows more flexibility to explore relationships. 
One of the features of RB++ is that you can restrict the 
information items (partition the information space) by mousing 
over any bars and other bars are proportionally highlighted to 
show the conditional distribution across all the facets. Note that 
the previous RB was limited to visualizing pairwise 
relationships with one main facet. Third, the RB++ added a 
dynamic filtering function for the result set (see Figure 3). Once 
the search results are displayed in the table, further filtering can 
be done by typing in keywords (string patterns) in the boxes 
located immediately above the result fields. The filtering is 
dynamic, which means that with each character typed in or 
removed from the boxes, RB++ matches the string patterns in 
the boxes with the corresponding field of the results. Only the 
matched results are then displayed immediately in the results 
panel and the matched string in the results is highlighted. This 
dynamic feature gives users instant and constant feedback about 
the filtered results and how many items they will get with 
different keywords, which allows users to try out different 
filtering keywords very easily and efficiently. Fourth, the RB++ 
provides an overview of the results set and tightly couples the 
overview and results set panels. The overview panel is 
dynamically updated to give users a contextualized overview of 
the updated result set. These new features give users more 
power to understand and explore the information collection and 
give them a flexible and rapid way to find the information they 
want. A linguistic model of BNF grammar to model the user
interaction with the interface is provided in section 2.3 to help 
reveal the dynamic nature of the RB++.
In the paper, we argue that the RB++ interface will bring users 
added values beyond simple searching and browsing by in fact 
combining these search strategies seamlessly. In the next 
section, the methodology of a user study is described. The 
results of the user study are then presented and discussed. 
Limitations of the interface and current efforts to deal with data 
classification are then described.

METHODOLOGY
The purpose of the user study was two-fold: first, we wanted to 
compare the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction 
associated with completing certain tasks using RB++ against 
that obtained by the traditional form-fillin search interface 
(baseline interface). Second, we wanted to explore if the RB++ 
interface would lead to new interaction patterns with the 
interface and if so, to determine what these new interaction 
patterns might be.

Seventeen undergraduate and graduate students were recruited 
from the UNC-Chapel Hill campus for this study. They came 
from various schools and departments. There were 10 females 
and 7 males with an age range from 19 to 44, (15 were in their 
20s, and all were familiar with www browsers. The participants 
were given $15 for their participation. The data from the first 
two participants was used as a pilot test; based on which the 
experimental protocol and instruments were revised. The data 
from the other 15 participants was used for the data analysis. 
The study proceeded in two phases, a within subjects 
comparison across two different interfaces for the same 
database, and an exploratory investigation with a single 
government statistical website instance of RB++.
2.1 Phase One: RB++ to Baseline 
Comparison for a Film Database
The first phase was a comparison study in which participants 
used both the RB++ interface and the baseline interface. The 
order of using these interfaces was counter balanced. The 
domain of the information items in both interfaces was the video 
collection in the UNC-CH library 
(http://www.lib.unc.edu/house/mrc/index.html?page=filmograph
y) that contains about 10000 films. The library online video 
search interface (Filmfinder) was used as our baseline interface. 
FilmFinder is a fairly typical www form-fillin search interface 
(see Figure 4 and Figure 5), where users can specify queries 
within fields such as title, release year, director, description, 
genre, origin, and format.

Figure 4. Filmfinder with Form-fillin Interface

Figure 5. Results Page of Filmfinder
All participants were run individually in sessions ranging from 
60-90 minutes and all sessions were video taped. The protocol 
for the first phase was as follows: First, a demographic pre-test 
questionnaire was completed. Second, the participant was 
trained for the first interface assigned in their condition. The 
training consisted of: an introduction to the features of the 
interface, a demo of each type of task with the interface, and 
participant practice using the interface until s/he was 
comfortable with it.  Third, the participant used the interface to 
complete 10 search tasks. Tasks were assigned to participants 
one by one by handing them pieces of paper for each task.   A 
timer was used to count time used to complete each task except 
for task 10 (see description of task 10 below). After each task, a 
short satisfaction questionnaire was completed by the 
participant. Fourth, a usability questionnaire was filled out after 
the participant finished using the first interface.  Next, the 
participant was trained for the second interface and the same 
procedures were used to complete 10 more search tasks.  
Finally, an open-ended questionnaire about perceived 
differences and preferences for the two interfaces was 
completed.
The tasks were classified into three different types: 1. Simple 
look up task. Tasks 1 to 3 in each task set were of this type. For 
example, "Check if the movie titled "The Matrix" is in the 
library movie collection." 2. Data exploration and analysis tasks. 
Tasks 4 to 9 in each task set were of this type. This kind of task 
requires users to understand and make sense of the information 
collection, which could be a starting point for them to further 
their searching or browsing. Two examples of this type are: "In 
which decade did "Steven Spielberg" direct the most movies?"; 
and "How many movie titles does the library hold that were 
released in the year 2000?" 3. Task 10 was a free exploration 
task, which asked participants to find five favorite videos 
without any time constraints. The tasks assigned for the two 
interfaces were different but comparable. For example, the 
comparable tasks for two interfaces simply substituted different 
video titles or directors.
2.2 Phase Two: Explore RB++ for EIA 
Website
The second phase was an exploratory study of the RB++ applied 
to roughly 10,000 pages in the Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) website. Based on intensive manual
181

inspection of the EIA website, four facets were identified with 
associated facet values: fuel type (with the facet values: 
alternatives, coal, electricity, natural gas, nuclear, petroleum, 
and renewable); geography (state level, regional level, national 
level, and international level); sector (commercial, electric 
utility, industrial, and residential); and process (delivery, 
import/export, price/cost, production, resources/reserves, and 
usage). All the facets were displayed on the overview panel (see 
Figure 6). The results panel displayed the title, page size, and 
description of the web pages.

Figure 6. RB++ interface applied to EIA website
The protocol of the second phase was as follows: First, the 
RB++ EIA application was introduced to the participant. 
Second, the participant practiced using the interface until s/he 
was comfortable with it. Third, the participant used the interface 
to complete four tasks
1
. The process was recorded and a short
satisfaction questionnaire was filled out after finishing each task. 
Fourth, an open-ended questionnaire was completed after 
finishing all the tasks. Lastly, the participant was briefly 
interviewed.
Data collected included both quantitative and qualitative data 
from the two phases of the study. Data collected for the first 
phase included performance data (time spent finishing tasks), 
error rates of tasks, ratings on the satisfaction questionnaire after 
finishing each task, ratings on the usability questionnaire after 
finishing each interface, and comments on the open 
questionnaire about perceived differences and preferences for 
the two interfaces. Data collected for the second phase included 
ratings on the satisfaction questionnaire after finishing each task, 
comments on the post-session questionnaire and the verbal 
comments made in the interview.

Tasks for the second phase study:

1. I want to learn the current status of Chinese nuclear energy.  
2. Find the most recent weekly data on  petroleum prices in the 
USA.  
3. Find the statistical data on coal production across different 
states in the year 2001.  
4. What kinds of information can I and can I not find from the 
website?

2.3 Modeling User Interaction
To help us form hypotheses and analyze and make sense of the 
experimental data, we employed a linguistic model, called BNF 
grammar, to model the user's interaction with the interface. BNF 
grammar was originally used by Reisner to describe the dialog 
grammar of an interactive graphics system [15], where the user's 
interaction with a system was seen as an action language and 
BNF grammar was used to formally describe the language. The 
BNF grammar consists of a set of rules which define higher 
level user behaviors in terms of lower level ones. Each rule can 
be composed of terminals, non-terminals, and a set of symbols. 
Terminals usually represent the lowest level of user behavior, 
such as pressing a key or clicking a mouse button and can not be 
further defined. Non-terminals represent a high level abstraction 
and can be defined in terms of other non-terminals and 
terminals. Terminals are written with upper case letters and non-terminals
are written with lower case letters. The "::=" symbol is 
read as " is defined as". The "+", "|" and "-" symbols are used at 
the right hand side of rules to connect, respectively, sequence of 
user behavior, set of options, and concurrent user behaviors. 
With the BNF grammar, we can describe the user's interaction 
with the RB++ as follows:
A1 information seeking ::= explore collection(A3) | (formulate 
query(A2) + CLICK SEARCH BUTTON + navigate 
results(A5))
A2 formulate query ::= (explore collection(A3) + form 
query(A4)) | form query(A4)
A3 explore collection ::= (CLICK VISUAL BAR-OBSERVE 
VISUAL BAR + explore collection(A3)) | (MOUSE OVER 
VISUAL BAR-OBSERVE VISUAL BAR + explore 
collection(A3))
A4 form query ::= (CLICK VISUAL BAR + form query(A4)) | 
(TYPE IN KEYWORD + form query(A4))
A5 navigate results ::= (browse results(A6) + navigate 
results(A5)) | (CLICK RESTART BUTTON + information 
seeking(A1))
A6 browse results ::= (show results(A7)-OBSERVE RESULTS 
+ browse results(A6)) | (CLICK RESULT ITEM + browse 
results(A6)) | (CLICK SORTING BUTTON + browse 
results(A6))| (explore results(A8) + browse results(A6))
A7 show results ::= CLICK SIDEBAR
A8 explore results ::= (observe system state(A9) + explore 
results(A8)) | (filter results(A10) + explore results(A8))
A9 observe system state ::= (OBSERVE VISUAL BAR + 
observe system state(A9)) | (OBSERVE NUMBER + observe 
system state (A9))
A10 filter results ::= CLICK VISUAL BAR | MOUSE OVER 
VISUAL BAR | TYPE IN KEYWORD
The interaction with baseline interface can be described as:
B1 information seeking ::= formulate query(B2) + CLICK 
SEARCH BUTTON + navigate results(B4)
B2 formulate query ::= (TYPE IN KEYWORD + formulate 
query(B2)) | (select item(B3) + formulate query(B2))
182

B3 select item ::= CLICK PULL DOWN MENU + CLICK 
ITEM
B4 navigate results ::= (browse results(B5) + navigate 
results(B4)) | (CLICK NEW SEARCH LINK + information 
seeking(B1))
B5 browse results ::= (show results(B6)-OBSERVE RESULTS 
+ browse results(B5)) | (show results(B6)-COUNT RESULTS + 
browse results(B5)) | (CLICK ITEM + browse results(B5)) | 
(CLICK SORTING LINK + browse results(B5))
B6 show results ::= CLICK SIDEBAR | (CLICK SIDEBAR + 
CLICK NEXT PAGE LINK)
The number of rules and options within rules reflects the 
interactive nature and number of alternative choices provided by 
these two interfaces.  Note that we used the terminals such as 
CLICK SEARCH BUTTON and CLICK VISUAL BAR which 
strictly speaking are not the lowest level of user behaviors, 
however, using higher level abstraction as terminals is suitable 
for interactive display-based systems [4] and ensures later data 
analysis. Many rules are defined recursively and consist of 
several options, which essentially reflect the interactivity of the 
graphical user interface (GUI). For example, a fairly interactive 
user behavior in RB++, "browse results (A6)", consists of either 
`OBSERVE RESULTS', `CLICK RESULT ITEM', `CLICK 
SORTING BUTTON', explore results, or any combination of 
the above.
From the BNF definition, we can see that RB++ is a more 
interactive interface than the baseline because it involves more 
rules and recursive definitions. However, it is not necessarily a 
complicated interface, since the rules for the RB++ interface are 
largely composed of a set of options instead of a sequence of 
user behaviors, which means that many rules are not executed 
for some types of tasks. Based on the BNF grammars, we 
hypothesize that for the simple search tasks, the RB++ interface 
will not necessarily be significantly different from the baseline 
interface, but for complicated searching and browsing tasks, that 
require more interaction or collection exploration, the RB++ will 
be significantly more effective, efficient, and satisfying than the 
baseline. For simple look up type tasks, both interfaces involve 
the sequence of user actions: formulate query, CLICK SEARCH 
BUTTON, and navigate results (see rule A1 and B1). 
Navigation of results is simple for this type of task in that it only 
involves the judgment of zero or non-zero results, which is 
trivial in both interfaces. Formulation of the query in this case 
involves typing in keywords and/or selecting the items from the 
interfaces (see rule A2, A4 and B2, B3). Even though item 
selection in the baseline interface involves two clicks (see rule 
B3) which means a slightly longer time to execute than in 
RB++, which only needs one click on the visual bar for item 
selection (see rule A4), we expected no significant difference. 
For type 2 tasks that involve data exploration and analysis, 
interaction with the visual bars of the RB++ interface provides 
an effective and efficient interaction style. Two typical 
sequences of user behaviors to complete type 2 tasks are: 
explore the collection by clicking (or mousing over) and 
observing the visual bars (see rule A1 and A3), or formulate a 
query and then explore the results by observing the visual bars 
(see rule A1, A5, A6, A8 and A9). With the traditional interface 
to finish type 2 tasks, users have to formulate a query and then
literally scan and count all the results (see rule B1, B4, B5, and 
B6), which is time consuming.
We also hypothesized that users would exhibit rich interaction 
during their navigation of the results with RB++ (see rule A5 to 
A10). Actions of typing in keywords and clicking visual bars to 
filter results (rule A10) would be used frequently and 
interchangeably by the users to finish complex search tasks, 
especially when large numbers of results are returned.
RESULTS
Table 1 lists the average time (in seconds) across all the 
participants to finish tasks 1 to 9 using the two different 
interfaces. Notice that we allowed the participants to stop the 
task if they felt that the task was too hard or too time-consuming 
to finish. It turned out that there were five participants who 
stopped task 5 and eight participants stopped task 6 before 
completion when they used the FilmFinder. Performance data of 
these participants were discarded for the unfinished tasks.

Paired sample t tests on the performance data were computed 
and the p values are shown in the parenthesis for each task. We 
can see that except for the first two tasks (which were type 1 
tasks), the performance differences between the two interfaces 
were all statistically significant at the .05 level. Clearly, RB++ 
supported superior performance for type 2 tasks.
We also counted error rates for tasks 1 to 9, which are listed in 
Table 2. The error rate was calculated as the number of 
participants who gave the wrong answer to the task divided by 
the total number of participants. We can see that except for the 
8th task, no participants got wrong answers for any of the tasks 
using the RB++ interface. The error rates of the baseline 
interface were much higher than that of the RB++ interface, 
especially for tasks 5, 6, and 7. Notice that we did not consider 
those participants who gave up the task 5 or 6 using the 
Filmfinder, so the actual denominators used for calculating the 
error rates for these tasks were smaller than the total number of 
participants.

We also did paired sample t tests on the three satisfaction 
questions
2
which were completed after each task. Each response
was given on a 5 point scale from strongly agree (5) to strongly 
disagree (1).  For the first three tasks (simple lookups), there 
were no statistically significant differences between the two 
interfaces on any of the 3 questions.  On the exploratory tasks 
(4-9), statistically significant differences favoring the RB++ 
were found on all three of the satisfaction questions.
We also compared the results for the seven overall usability 
questions on each interface asked after participants had done the 
tasks with each interface. Their responses were also given on a 
five point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. In each 
of the seven ratings, statistically significant differences were 
found favoring the RB+ interface. Clearly, satisfaction with the 
RB++ was greater than that with the Filmfinder.
There were also open-ended questions that the participants 
answered after finishing both interfaces.  All of the participants 
considered the RB++ interface to be easier to use, especially for 
the complex searches. They commented on the easy use of the 
visual display with the multiple categories, which made it easy 
to combine the search criteria and narrow down the data, and 
they also thought it was good to be able to manipulate the search 
results in multiple ways.  Thirteen out of 15 participants 
indicated that the RB++ interface gave them more confidence to 
complete the tasks. It was easy to go back and forth and to verify 
the results and the informative overview panel gave the 
participants more confidence to finish tasks. There was one 
participant who thought that both interfaces gave equal 
confidence and there was one participant who thought that the 
Filmfinder interface gave more confidence since he was more 
familiar with the Filmfinder and he felt somewhat confused by 
the dynamic feature of the RB++, but he acknowledged the 
usefulness of the dynamic feature in narrowing the results in the 
results panel.
When asked which interface better helped them gain an 
understanding of the library movie collection, the RB++ 
interface was chosen by all the participants. Again the visual 
display of the multiple categories and the cross reference of 
these categories was considered to be useful features for them to 
understand the whole collection. In addition, 10 out of the 15 
participants indicated that they were more likely to use the 
RB++ interface if both were available.  Three participants chose 
both interfaces, depending on the type of tasks, and two 
participants chose the FilmFinder because of its familiarity and 
aesthetic appeal.
For the question on the best thing about the RB++, participants 
pointed out the visual display of the multiple categories, its cross 
reference ability, the dynamic matching ability of the searching 
boxes and the one screen display of the results as opposed to the 
multiple page display of results in Filmfinder. As the worst thing 
about the RB++, participants indicated that it was not as

I feel confident with the results I got

aesthetically appealing as the Filmfinder and not quite as 
intuitive to use as the Filmfinder. Two participants specifically 
mentioned that the constant changing and updating of the 
interface made it a bit confusing.
3.2 Phase Two Results
During the second phase we also asked participants to fill out 
the satisfaction questionnaires after finishing each task and these 
ratings were predictably high (all means above 3.5)  More 
importantly, participants were also required to answer a set of 
open-ended questions after finishing the second phase. For the 
first question: "What is your overall impression of this interface 
for finding the statistical data?" the overall impression was 
positive. Participants used phrases such as "fairly easy to use", 
"very helpful in finding the information", "good for quick 
searching". There were also a couple of negative comments such 
as: "interface still came up with many results after filtering", 
"title of the results are not descriptive enough". Only one 
participant said that he did not like the interface, because of the 
poor categorization of information items under some categories 
which made him frustrated.
When answering the second question: "Was it helpful to 
understanding what is available at EIA?" all the participants 
thought the interface was helpful in that regard, which was 
largely attributed to the visual display of the categories, which 
gave them a sense of what the website covered. One participant 
wished that there were more categories displayed.  The 
questionnaire also asked if the search boxes were helpful in 
completing the tasks.  Participants gave high praise to this 
feature with comments such as "it's great to be taken directly to 
the page but not to have your results lost", "I like the way it 
narrows the focus and sort of guides a person to the info 
sought", "I didn't have to be concerned with performing a 
complex search that may return a null set-the results reflected 
my search string instantly".  Two participants also commented 
that the feature was somewhat limited in use since relevant 
information may not appear in the title, or description.

DISCUSSION
The results strongly support that the RB++ interface was more 
effective and efficient in completing type 2 tasks than the 
baseline interface and that users felt more confident and satisfied 
with the RB++ in completing type 2 tasks. The higher 
effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction gained in the RB++ 
resulted mainly from two aspects: the visual display of the 
statistical summary of the information items and the dynamic 
keyword searching capability in the results panel. The 
visualization bars helped the users understand relative 
proportions of items at a glance and use the posting numbers 
directly, which is much faster than literally counting. If we look 
at the BNF grammar, completion of type 2 tasks in RB++ only 
required participants to explore the collection (see first option of 
rule A1) without submitting queries to the database and then 
observing and counting returned results, which are necessary 
steps for the baseline interface to complete the same tasks (see 
rule B1).
The dynamic search boxes allow users do further filtering based 
on certain criteria and give users feedback on the filtered results 
instantly and continuously, which not only encourages the users 
to use this function, but also improves their efficiency. Another
184

interface feature: displaying all the results on one screen might 
also help improve the efficiency and satisfaction, as several 
users mentioned.
Several components were tightly coupled in the interface with 
displayed search results. The search boxes are tightly coupled 
with the results, which means that any input in the search boxes 
will invoke instant filtering on the results. The visual bars are 
tightly coupled with the results and as such they support two 
functions. One is that any operations on the visual bars such as 
mouse over and selection, invoke the instant filtering of the 
results. The other is that any update of the results also updates 
the summary statistics in the visualization on the bars. Coupling 
provides users more ways to interact with the system and make 
the interaction more natural and smooth (see rule A8, A9, A10), 
which suggests a different interaction style for finding 
information than traditional search interfaces which tend to 
require discrete, well-defined turn-taking between the user and 
system. Traditionally, when users get to the results page, all they 
can do is browse the results. If they want to refine the results, 
they have to go back to the search interface, type in the refined 
keywords, click the search, and browse the new results, which 
not only interrupts the normal results browsing interaction, but 
also loses the current result set. RB++ encourages users to get an 
initial manageable result set and then refine it using one 
interface window without the need to go back and forth. Instead 
of displaying a set of static results, RB++ offers an effective and 
efficient means for users to understand the results by displaying 
summary statistics bars which give both visual and numeric data 
(see rule A9), and to explore results by providing ways to 
dynamically and continuously filter (see rule A10). The result 
set can be as large as displaying the whole collection, or as small 
as only one item, which depends on the initial query on the 
collection. In the second phase study, most of the participants 
completed their search tasks without doing a second query on 
the initial interface. The study showed that participants could 
utilize the initial interface to get an initial result set by selecting 
relevant categories and then narrow down results and find 
relevant web pages by exploring the results set. Typing in 
keywords (or string patterns) in search boxes was found to be 
the most frequently used means to explore and filter result set. 
These features were highly appreciated by the participants as 
seen from their comments.

RELATED WORK
Many information access interfaces try to provide a starting 
point for users by presenting overviews of the collection [9]. 
Overviews can help users understand the whole collection and 
select or eliminate sources from consideration. Overviews can 
direct users to subcollections quickly, where they can explore 
the details. Usually two types of overviews are employed: 
category overview and graphic overview. The category approach 
of Yahoo is a good example for the category overview. The 
HiBrowse interface for viewing category labels hierarchically 
based on the facets is another example [14]. A more recent 
information access interface using the category overview by 
presenting faceted metadata is the Flamenco interface [21]. The 
last two interfaces not only present the category labels to the 
users but also inform the users of the number of documents 
under each category. However, these interfaces do not allow 
users to employ simple mouse moves to quickly explore the 
relationship between different categories (or facets). The
Flamenco interface could do this as part of its browsing and 
searching efforts, but it requires many commitments from users 
such as clicking the category and waiting. The previous version 
of the relation browser [13] presented various categories and 
allowed users to explore the relations by mouse over operation, 
but the interface only allowed the users to mouse over the main 
category.
The graphic overview is another type of overview, which 
usually employs various information visualization techniques. 
Lin [12] used the Kohenen map to visually present a topical 
overview of the collection. Each block on the map represents a 
subcollection with similar topics which are labeled by one or 
two salient words extracted from the subcollection. The 
adjacency of blocks indicates the topic similarity between 
subcollections. Wise, et al. [19] developed a three dimensional 
interface to visually present various topics. Zhang, et al. [25] 
exacted the key concepts from a collection and visually 
presented the concepts in a spring-embedded graph. Similar 
concepts were clustered together and usually represented as 
subtopics. The graphical overview is visually appealing, but the 
usability of this kind of interface has yet to be explored. 3-D 
interfaces are more problematic than 2-D interface in terms of 
ease of use and learnability. It seems that textual labels of 
category structure are more understandable than graphical 
representation.
Some research has been conducted on how to present the 
retrieved results in context. Hearst [10] used clustering 
techniques to cluster retrieval results on the fly and presented 
different clusters with labeled words to the users to help them 
understand of the results. Chen, and Dumais [3] employed 
classification techniques to categorize retrieved results based on 
the existing category structure and displayed them in 
hierarchical categories. Zamir and Etzioni [22] developed an 
interface that used on-the-fly clustering of metasearch results. 
These interfaces cluster or categorize the retrieval results on the 
fly, so scaling is problematic. The RB++ categorizes the 
collection offline and uses a uniform category structure to 
present overviews of the collection and the retrieval results. 
Consequently, RB++ can be scaled up easily.  However, because 
RB++ depends on the metadata to reside on the client side to 
achieve its dynamics, it also suffers a different kind of 
scalability limitation.  To date, we have had good success and 
response with data sets with tens of thousands of records and a 
dozen or so facets, however data sets with millions of records 
and scores of facets are problematic.

There also has been some work on fast location of specific 
information items. Sorting is a prevalent means to help users 
locate a specific item. However, users still need to visually go 
through a list of items. The Alphaslider [1] is a visual 
component to help users quickly locate a known string of items, 
but it's not very easy to use, especially for novice users. Besides, 
The Alphaslider can only locate the information items based on 
the first letter alphabetically. RB++ provides an easy and 
flexible way to locate the information items by typing in string 
patterns and the patterns can be matched anywhere in the 
information items. A similar technique is actually used in some 
applications such as the address box of Internet Explorer

browser, but the patterns are limited to matching from the 
beginning of the query string.
Dynamic query was a new type of interface [16] that inspired 
the original relation browser work. The interface visually 
displays the information items and provides the visual 
controlling components to explore the information items by 
tightly coupling search and visual display of results. RB++ uses 
this design concept, but instead of providing a visual interface, 
RB++ employs a more understandable (especially for topical 
overview) category structure for the information items. 
Moreover, the search box is a very effective and efficient 
component for the non categorized attributes of the items, while 
the visual controlling components such as sliders or check boxes 
can only be used for controlling categorical attributes of the 
items.
Query preview [18], attribute explorer [17] and other interfaces 
[11], and [20] provide similar ways to explore the relationships 
between different facets of the classification. These interfaces 
worked for structured information such as that found in 
databases. Of course, all these types of interfaces depend on 
good underlying categorization of data.  Our long-term goal is to 
make the interface work for unstructured textual information. 
The search boxes provided are a first step in this direction, 
although they are currently limited to search within the fields 
specified in the results display.

LIMITATIONS OF RB++ AND ONGOING WORK
One constraint in RB++ is the limited number of categories that 
can be displayed, which is affected by two factors. One factor is 
screen real estate. We can partially alleviate the issue of screen 
real estate by utilizing a Zoomable User Interface (ZUI) to 
display the categories. We have experimented with integrating 
the Jazz toolkit [2] into the interface and this provides 
aproximately a ten-fold increase in the number of facet values 
that can be supported within each facet, although at the expense 
of some of the mouseover dynamics since the mouse must now 
be used for zooming as well as normal hovering. Another factor 
is size of the memory to hold the client-side distribution counts 
data, the number of which increases exponentially with 
increased number of displayed categories. One way to solve the 
issue is to only calculate part of the distribution counts data, 
which hopefully are most frequently used during the user's 
interaction with the interface. Other approaches, such as 
employing novel data structures were also suggested by Doan, et 
al. [5]. However, all these solutions have to sacrifice the 
interactivity of the interface that depends on client-side metadata 
to support rapid mouse activities. For example, preloading 
partial distribution counts data for large numbers of categories 
make some distributional data and visualization unavailable 
when users try to re-partition the information space by mouse 
moves.  At present, the best development path seems to be 
hierarchical partitioning of very large information spaces with 
multiple RB++ instances that require a new download for each 
of the cascading subsets.
Another constraint of RB++ is the limited matching function of 
the search boxes. The interface currently matches input string 
patterns to the corresponding result fields on the lexical level. 
Matching in this level is sufficient in many cases such as 
matching with fields with numbers or short textual strings such
as titles, but for the fields with more semantic bearing strings 
such as descriptions of web pages, a more sophisticated match 
function based on semantics might be needed--perhaps a kind 
of full-text engine in each text field, although the close coupling 
with the facet panel will then be in doubt.
Currently, the interface provides a uniform category structure 
for both the entire collection and the retrieved results set. This is 
good for its consistency. However, for the retrieved result set, a 
more fine-grained category structure might be better for users to 
understand it and conduct string searches.
Overall, the RB++ represents an example of a highly interactive 
user interface that offers improved performance and satisfaction 
for users of large websites and digital libraries.  It can find 
application as the entry point for a large website or as a way to 
work with large results sets returned from search engines as long 
as the data is structured in advance.

WORK ON AUTOMATIC CLUSTERING AND CLASSIFICATION
Over the past few years we have created more than two dozen 
instances of data sets using RB and RB++, demonstrating its 
applicability as an interface to many different types of data.  If 
the data resides in a database, it is possible to map the scheme to 
the underlying RB++ scheme (see [24] for details on the system 
architecture) and simply import the data automatically.  For 
many WWW applications, this is not possible so we have been 
developing ways to automate facet discovery and webpage 
assignment to those facets.  The basic approach is to crawl the 
website(s), create term-document representations and then use 
machine learning techniques to cluster the webpages and extract 
candidate labels, use human judgment to select the best labels, 
and then classify the webpages into those categories using the 
statistical model produced in the process.  See Efron et al [6,7] 
for details of the techniques we have applied to date.
To illustrate the current state of development, consider the EIA 
example used in the study reported here.  The categories 
displayed on the EIA RB++ instance were originally created 
manually, which certainly did not scale well to many other large 
information collections such as various other government 
statistical web sites. Figure 7 is a screen shot of the RB++ 
instance for the Bureau of Labor Statistics web site that uses 
topic facets and webpage assignment that were automatically 
determined. About 13,000 HTML web pages were crawled from 
web site and a soft clustering method was then applied to those 
pages. For each webpage, the statistical model yielded a 
probability of belonging to every cluster. Thus, every page 
`belongs' to every cluster at some level of probability. The first 
topic column contains all the pages with highest probability of 
belonging to those facet values.  The second column contains all 
the pages with the second highest probability values for those 
facet values.  The third and fourth columns are the months and 
years of page update extracted from web pages themselves-facets
that are know to be problematic but used for illustration 
since our primary emphasis was on topic discovery. The display 
of two topical columns reflects the underlying characteristic of 
soft clustering where items can appear in multiple clusters. 
However, our discussions with BLS staff and demonstrations to 
other potential users show that this two-column display is 
confusing. Therefore, only the first topical column was kept in a 
later version of the RB++ BLS instance (see figure 8). An
186

additional facet: geographical coverage, which is an important 
facet of government statistical web sites, was added in this 
version. The assignments were made using a rule based 
classification method to classify the web pages into categories of 
various geographical coverages.

Figure 8. Latest version of RB instance for BLS web site.
In addition to the BLS instance, we have used these techniques 
to create RB++ instances for the FedStats website and are 
working to create instances for other federal statistical agencies.  
At present, the FedStats and BLS instances are installed on 
FedStats servers and are being tested by federal statistical 
agency personnel.  We also hope to address the important facet 
of time coverage of data itself in future work.
Overall, the RB++ user interface has evolved to a state where it 
can be easily applied to many kinds of well-structured data.  The 
user testing reported here demonstrates the efficacy of the 
interface for search and browse tasks that would be very difficult 
to execute with SQL syntax or form fillin interfaces.  Our 
current efforts are to develop techniques for automatically 
populating the RB++ database with unstructured data from the
WWW.  To date, these efforts have led to promising prototypes 
for several federal statistical websites.
