<DIV style="position:absolute;top:354;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">This paper focuses on defending against compromised nodes'<br>dropping of legitimate reports and investigates the misbe-<br>havior of a maliciously packet-dropping node in sensor net-<br>works. We present a resilient packet-forwarding scheme us-<br>ing Neighbor Watch System (NWS), specifically designed<br>for hop-by-hop reliable delivery in face of malicious nodes<br>that drop relaying packets, as well as faulty nodes that<br>fail to relay packets. Unlike previous work with multipath<br>data forwarding, our scheme basically employs single-path<br>data forwarding, which consumes less power than multipath<br>schemes. As the packet is forwarded along the single-path<br>toward the base station, our scheme, however, converts into<br>multipath data forwarding at the location where NWS de-<br>tects relaying nodes' misbehavior. Simulation experiments<br>show that, with the help of NWS, our forwarding scheme<br>achieves a high success ratio in face of a large number of<br>packet-dropping nodes, and effectively adjusts its forwarding<br>style, depending on the number of packet-dropping nodes<br>en-route to the base station.</span></nobr></DIV>

In such a<br>network, a large number of sensor nodes are distributed to<br>monitor a vast field where the operational conditions are<br>harsh or even hostile. To operate in such environments, se-<br>curity is an important aspect for sensor networks and secu-<br>rity mechanisms should be provided against various attacks<br>such as node capture, physical tampering, eavesdropping,<br>denial of service, etc [23, 33, 38].</span></nobr></DIV>

[46] is a good solution against such an in-<br>sider attack. Since the scheme does not allow a cloned node<br>(by inside-attackers) to establish pairwise keys with any le-<br>gitimate nodes except the neighbors of the compromised<br>nodes, the cryptographic keys extracted from the compro-<br>mised node are of no use for attackers.</span></nobr></DIV>

Proposed<br>en-route filtering mechanisms [8, 39, 41, 44, 47] that de-<br>tect and drop such false reports effectively limit the impact<br>of this type of attacks. Also, proposed secure aggregation<br>protocols [34, 40] have addressed the problem of false data<br>injection, and they ensure that the aggregated result is a<br>good approximation to the true value in the presence of a<br>small number of compromised nodes.</span></nobr></DIV>

In order to bypass such nodes, most work<br>on secure routing and reliable delivery in sensor networks re-<br>lies on multipath forwarding scheme [5, 6, 7, 10], or interleaved-<br>mesh forwarding scheme [26, 29, 39, 42].</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:298;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">Sensor networks typically comprise one or multiple base</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:314;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">stations and hundreds or thousands of inexpensive, small,<br>static, and resource-constrained nodes scattered over a wide<br>area.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:361;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">resistant packaging. We assume that a large number of sen-<br>sor nodes are deployed in high density over a vast field, such<br>that the expected degree of a node is high; each sensor has<br>multiple neighbors within its communication range. Sensing<br>data or aggregated data are sent along the multihop route<br>to the base station. We assume that each sensor node has<br>a constant transmission range, and communication links are<br>bidirectional.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:486;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">Our sensor network model employs a key-establishment</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">scheme that extends the one in LEAP [46] where the im-<br>pact of a node compromise is localized in the immediate<br>neighborhood of the compromised node, and our scheme is<br>based on it. To evolve from LEAP, we will describe it briefly<br>in Section 2.4.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:612;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">The attacks launched from outsiders hardly cause much</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:627;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">damage to the network, since the rouge node, which does not<br>possesses the legitimate credentials (e.g. the predistributed<br>key ring from the key pool [13]), fails to participate in the<br>network. On the other hand, there may be multiple attacks<br>from insiders (e.g.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:706;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">false sensing reports, advertising inconsistent route infor-<br>mation, and eavesdropping in-network communication us-<br>ing exposed keys, etc), and the combination of such attacks<br>can lead to disruption of the whole network. Thus, proper<br>security countermeasures (specifically designed to protect<br>against each type of the attacks) should be provided.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:800;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">Among them, in this paper, we focus on defending against</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:816;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">compromised nodes' dropping of legitimate reports; Other<br>attacks mentioned above are effectively dealt with by several<br>proposed schemes as described in the previous section.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:863;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">We consider a packet-dropping node as not merely a faulty</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:878;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">node, but also an arbitrarily malicious node. Some previous<br>work [3, 29, 36] on reliable delivery uses an acknowledge-<br>ment (ACK) that its packets were correctly received at the<br>next-hop node, in order to find out unreliable links. How-<br>ever, in the presence of maliciously packet-dropping nodes,<br>simply receiving ACK from a next-hop node does not guar-<br>antee that the packet will be really forwarded by the next-<br>hop node. For example, node u forwards a packet to com-<br>promised node v, and node u waits for ACK from node v.<br>Node v sends back ACK to node u, and then node v silently<br>drops the packet. This simple example shows that receiving<br>ACK is not enough for reliable delivery in face of maliciously<br>packet-dropping nodes.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:479;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">our scheme, however, sub-watch nodes w and y are just on<br>watch in designated next-hop node v, instead of uncondi-<br>tionally forwarding the packet.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:557;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">However, a packet-dropping triggers the multipath for-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:573;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">warding for the dropped packet. If the designated next-hop<br>node v in Figure 1 has not forwarded the relaying packet to<br>its certified neighbor by a certain timeout, sub-watch nodes<br>w and y forward the packet to their respective next-hop.<br>At the point, the packet is sent over multiple paths. Since<br>the location where the packet-dropping occurs is likely in<br>an unreliable region, this prompt reaction of the conver-<br>sion to multipath forwarding augments the robustness in our<br>scheme. The degree of multipath depends on the number of<br>the sub-watch nodes. Figure 2 shows an example of our<br>packet-forwarding scheme, bypassing two packet-dropping<br>nodes en-route to the base station. If a node utilizes a cache<br>[16, 21] for recently-received packets, it can suppress the<br>same copy of previously-received one within a certain time-<br>out, as nodes u and v in Figure 2.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:808;left:489"><nobr><span class="ft3">Our scheme requires that a relaying packet should be en-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:824;left:475"><nobr><span class="ft7">crypted with a cluster key of a forwarding node, in order<br>that all its neighbors can decrypt and overhear it. In fact,<br>per-link encryption provides better robustness to a node<br>compromise, since a compromised node can decrypt only<br>the packets addressed to it. Thus, there exists a tradeoff<br>between resiliency against packet-dropping and robustness<br>to a node compromise. However, encryption with a cluster<br>key provides an intermediate level of robustness to a node<br>compromise [24] (a compromised node can overhear only<br>its immediate neighborhood), and also supports local broad-<br>cast (i.e. resiliency against packet-dropping), so that we can<br>achieve graceful degradation in face of compromised nodes.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:102;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">must address the problem of how a node proves that it re-<br>ally has the claimed neighbors. It is the identical problem of<br>how a node verifies the existence of its neighbors' neighbors.<br>Apparently, a node has the knowledge of its direct neigh-<br>bors by neighbor discovery and pairwise key establishment<br>phases. However, in the case of two-hop away neighbors,<br>as in Figure 1, malicious node v can inform its neighbor u<br>that it also has neighbor node x (any possible id in the net-<br>work) which in fact is not a neighbor of node v. Node u has<br>to believe it, since node x is not a direct neighbor of node<br>u, and only the node v itself knows its actual surrounding<br>neighbors. Then, how do we verify the neighbors' neigh-<br>bors? The answer to this critical question is described in<br>the next subsection.</span></nobr></DIV>

Unlike that with N =<br>300, the success ratio stays constantly at around 0.99 even<br>with x = 100, with the help of NWS. This tendency of high<br>success ratio can be mainly attributed to the degree d = 20<br>(7.6 sub-watch nodes on average in the lower bound case),<br>which is found to be high enough to bypass a large number<br>of packet-dropping nodes. Figure 6(d) shows the number<br>of relaying nodes from the source to the base station in the<br>same experiments. With NWS, the increase in the number<br>of relaying nodes with x is more conspicuous than that with<br>N = 300, since more than twice as many as sub-watch nodes<br>help forward the packets so that it can bypass a large number<br>of packet-dropping nodes anyway.</span></nobr></DIV>

As in Figures 6(c) and 6(d), while there exist none<br>or a small number of packet-dropping nodes on the way, our<br>scheme works almost like the single-path forwarding with<br>the help of a few additional relaying nodes. On the other<br>hand, when confronting a large number of packet-dropping<br>nodes, our scheme makes full use of the help from additional<br>relaying nodes, in order to successfully deliver the packet to<br>the base station at any cost to the best efforts.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:612;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">nodes' dropping of legitimate reports. We have presented<br>a resilient packet-forwarding scheme using Neighbor Watch<br>System (NWS) against maliciously packet-dropping nodes in<br>sensor networks. In face of such nodes, NWS is specifically<br>designed for hop-by-hop reliable delivery, and the prompt<br>reaction of the conversion from single-path to multipath for-<br>warding augments the robustness in our scheme so that the<br>packet successfully reach the base station.</span></nobr></DIV>
