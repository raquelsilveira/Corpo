listings on houses for sale in a specific city could be regarded
as a local page, likely to be of interest only to an audience
in a relatively narrow region. Similarly, some search
engine queries (implicitly) target global pages, while other
queries are after local pages.
For example, the best results
for query [wildflowers] are probably global pages about
wildflowers such as the one discussed above. However, local
pages that are relevant to, say, San Francisco are likely
to be good matches for a query [houses for sale] that was
issued by a San Francisco resident or by somebody moving
to that city. Unfortunately, search engines do not analyze
the geographical locality of queries and users, and hence
often produce sub-optimal results. Thus query [wildflowers
] might return pages that discuss wildflowers in specific
U.S. states (and not general information about wildflowers),
while query [houses for sale] might return pages with real
estate listings for locations other than that of interest to the
person who issued the query. Deciding whether an unseen
query should produce mostly local or global pages--without
placing this burden on the search engine users--is an important
and challenging problem, because queries are often
ambiguous or underspecify the information they are after.
In this paper, we address this problem by first defining how
to categorize queries according to their (often implicit) geographical
locality. We then introduce several alternatives
for automatically and efficiently categorizing queries in our

<SECTION header="INTRODUCTION">Web pages (and resources, in general) can be characterized
according to their geographical locality. For example, a
web page with general information about wildflowers could
be considered a global page, likely to be of interest to a ge-ographically
broad audience. In contrast, a web page with
listings on houses for sale in a specific city could be regarded
as a local page, likely to be of interest only to an audience in
a relatively narrow region. Earlier research [9] has addressed
the problem of automatically computing the "geographical
scope" of web resources.
Often search engine queries (implicitly) target global web
pages, while other queries are after local pages. For example,
the best results for query [wildflowers] are probably global
pages about wildflowers discussing what types of climates
wildflowers grow in, where wildflowers can be purchased,
or what types of wildflower species exist. In contrast, local
pages that are relevant to, say, San Francisco are likely to
be good matches for a query [houses for sale] that was issued
by a San Francisco resident, or by somebody moving
to San Francisco, even if "San Francisco" is not mentioned
in the query. The user's intent when submitting a query
may not be always easy to determine, but if underspecified
queries such as [houses for sale] can be detected, they can
be subsequently modified by adding the most likely target
geographical location or by getting further user input to cus-tomize
the results.
Unfortunately, search engines do not analyze the geographical
locality of queries and users, and hence often produce
sub-optimal results, even if these results are on-topic
and reasonably "popular" or "authoritative." Thus query
[wildflowers] might return pages that discuss wildflowers in
specific U.S. states (and not general information about wildflowers
). In fact, as of the writing of this paper, the first
10 results that Google provides for this query include 5
pages each of which discusses wildflowers in only one U.S.
325
state (e.g., "Texas Wildflowers"). Similarly, the top 10 results
that Google returns for query [houses for sale] include
real estate pages for Tuscany, United Kingdom, and New
Zealand.
These pages are likely to be irrelevant to, say,
somebody interested in San Francisco real estate who types
such an underspecified query.
Deciding whether a query posed by a regular search engine
user should produce mostly local or global pages is an important
and challenging problem, because queries are often
ambiguous or underspecify the information they are after,
as in the examples above. By identifying that, say, query
[wildflowers] is likely after "global" information, a search
engine could rank the results for this query so that state-specific
pages do not appear among the top matches. By
identifying that, say, query [houses for sale] is likely after
"local" information, a search engine could filter out pages
whose geographical locality is not appropriate for the user
who issued the query. Note that deciding which location
is of interest to a user who wrote an underspecified query
such as [houses for sale] is an orthogonal, important issue
that we do not address in this paper. Our focus is on identifying
that such a query is after "local" pages in nature,
and should therefore be treated differently by a search engine
than queries that are after "global" pages. By knowing
that a user query is after local information, a search engine
might choose to privilege pages whose geographical locality
coincides with that of the user's or, alternatively, attempt
to obtain further input from the user on what location is of
interest.
In this paper, we first define how to categorize user queries
according to their (often implicit) geographical locality. We
then introduce several alternatives for automatically and efficiently
classifying queries according to their locality, using
a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We report
a thorough evaluation of our classifiers using a large
sample of queries from a real web search engine query log.
Finally, we discuss how our query categorization approach
can help improve query result quality. The specific contributions
of this paper are as follows:
· A discussion on how to categorize user queries according
to their geographical locality, based on a careful
analysis of a large query log from the Excite web site
(Section 3).
· A feature representation for queries; we derive the feature
representation of a query from the results produced
for the query by a web search engine such as
Google (Section 4.1).
· A variety of automatic query classification strategies
that use our feature representation for queries (Section
4.2).
· A large-scale experimental evaluation of our strategies
over real search engine queries (Section 5).
· Preliminary query reformulation and page re-ranking
strategies that exploit our query classification techniques
to improve query result quality (Section 6).

<SECTION header="RELATED WORK">Traditional information-retrieval research has studied how
to best answer keyword-based queries over collections of text
documents [18].
These collections are typically assumed
to be relatively uniform in terms of, say, their quality and
scope. With the advent of the web, researchers are studying
other "dimensions" to the data that help separate useful resources
from less-useful ones in an extremely heterogeneous
environment like the web. Notably, the Google search engine
[4] and the HITS algorithm [7, 13] estimate the "impor-tance"
of web pages by analyzing the hyperlinks that point
to them, thus capturing an additional dimension to the web
data, namely how important or authoritative the pages are.
Ding et al. [9] extract yet another crucial dimension of the
web data, namely the geographical scope of web pages. For
example, the Stanford Daily newspaper has a geographical
scope that consists of the city of Palo Alto (where Stanford
University is located), while the New York Times newspaper
has a geographical scope that includes the entire U.S.
To compute the geographical scope of a web page, Ding et
al. propose two complementary strategies: a technique based
on the geographical distribution of HTML links to the page,
and a technique based on the distribution of geographical
references in the text of the page. Ding et al. report on
a search-engine prototype that simply filters out from the
results for a user query any pages not in the geographical
scope of the user. This technique does not attempt to determine
whether a query is best answered with "global" or
"local" pages, which is the focus of our paper. Ding et al.
built on the work by Buyukkokten et al. [6], who discussed
how to map a web site (e.g., http://www-db.stanford.edu)
to a geographical location (e.g., Palo Alto) and presented a
tool to display the geographical origin of the HTML links
to a given web page. This tool then helps visualize the geographical
scope of web pages [6].
A few commercial web sites manually classify web resources
by their location, or keep directory information that
lists where each company or web site is located. The North-ernLight
search engine
1
extracts addresses from web pages,
letting users narrow their searches to specific geographical
regions (e.g., to pages "originated" within a five-mile radius
of a given zip code). Users benefit from this information
because they can further filter their query results. McCurley
[14] presented a variety of approaches for recognizing
geographical references on web pages, together with a nav-igational
tool to browse pages by geographical proximity
and their spatial context. (Please refer to [16] for additional
references.) None of these techniques addresses our focus
problem in this paper: automatically determining the geographical
locality associated with a given, unmodified search
engine query.
</SECTION>
<SECTION header="DEFINING GEOGRAPHICAL LOCALITY">As discussed above, queries posed to a web search engine
can be regarded as local, if their best matches are likely to
be "local" pages, or as global, if their best matches are likely
to be "global" pages. In an attempt to make this distinction
more concrete, we now discuss several examples of local and
global queries.
Global queries often do not include a location name, as
is the case for query [Perl scripting]. A user issuing this
query is probably after tutorials about the Perl language,
and hence pages on the topic with a restricted geographi-1

cal scope are less desirable than global pages. Other global
queries do not mention a location explicitly either, but are
topically associated with one particular location. An example
of such a query is [Elgin marbles], which is topically associated
with the city of Athens. We consider these queries
as global, since their best matches are broad, global pages,
not localized pages with a limited geographical scope. In-terestingly
, global queries sometimes do include a location
name. For example, a query might be just a location name
(e.g., [Galapagos Islands]) or a request for concrete information
about a location (e.g., [Boston area codes]). General
resources about the location (e.g., tourist guides) are
arguably to be preferred for such queries, which are hence
regarded as global. Other global queries include locations
that are strongly associated topic-wise with the rest of the
query. Query [Woody Allen NYC] is an example of such a
query. The location mentioned in this query (i.e., "NYC,"
for "New York City") is not used to restrict query results to
pages of interest to New York residents, but rather expresses
a topic specification. Query [Ansel Adams Yosemite] is another
example: photographer Ansel Adams took a famous
series of photographs in Yosemite.
Local queries often include a location name, as is the case
for query [Wisconsin Christmas tree producers association].
The location mentioned in this query (i.e., "Wisconsin") is
used to "localize" the query results. Query [houses for sale
New York City] is a related example. Other local queries
do not include a location name, but still implicitly request
"localized" results. Query [houses for sale] is an example of
such a query. These queries tend to be underspecified, but
are still asked by (presumably na¨ive) search engine users.
We conducted a thorough examination of a large number
(over 1,200) of real search engine queries. Most queries
that we encountered can be cleanly categorized as being either
global or local. However, other queries are inherently
ambiguous, and their correct category is impossible to determine
without further information on the user intent behind
them. For example, query [New York pizza] could be con-strued
as a local query if it is, say, after pizza delivery web
sites for the New York area. In contrast, the same query
could be regarded as a global query if the user who issues it
wants to learn about the characteristics of New York-style
pizza.
</SECTION>
<SECTION header="USING CLASSIFIERS TO DETERMINE LOCALITY">We earlier established that queries are associated with local
or global status, which influences the kind of results that
are desirable. Since current search engines do not directly
take into account geographical information, for certain types
of queries they produce a large number of on-topic but un-wanted
results, as in the [houses for sale] example discussed
earlier. In this section, we discuss automatic methods that
can determine, given a query, whether the query is a local
or global one. To build the two-class classifier, we experimented
with several state-of-the-art classification techniques
, using widely available implementations for each. We
describe below the features used in the classification, how we
extract them from web pages, and the classifiers with which
we experimented.
4.1
Classification Features
Web queries, which we treat in this paper as ordered bags
of words with no other structure, are typically fairly short.
In the collection of 2,477,283 real queries that we used in
our experiments (Section 5.1), 84.9% were five words long
or shorter. Because few words are available per query, basing
the classification directly on the words in the query may
lead to severe sparse data problems. Even more importantly,
some of the characteristics that make a query local or global
are not directly observable in the query itself, but rather in
the results returned. For example, a query that returns results
that contain few references to geographical locations is
likely to be global, while a query that returns results spread
uniformly over many locations without including a significant
percentage of results with no locations is likely to be
local.
For these reasons, we base our classification on a sample
of results actually returned for a given query rather than the
words in the query itself. By observing distributional characteristics
in the unmodified results, the classifier can infer
the type of the query (global or local) so that the results can
be appropriately filtered or re-ordered, or the query modified
. In a way the approach is similar in spirit to query
expansion techniques that rely on pseudo-relevance feedback
[5].
In our experiments, we use Google (via the Google
API
2
) to obtain the top 50 web pages that match the query.
For simplicity, we limited our search to HTML pages, skipping
over non-HTML documents. We chose Google because
it represents state-of-the-art web search technology and offers
a published interface for submitting large numbers of
queries.
We represent the web pages returned by Google as text
documents. This conversion is achieved by using the
lynx
HTML browser with the -dump option. We base our classification
features on measures of frequency and dispersion of
location names in these text files. For this purpose, we have
constructed a database of 1,605 location names by concatenating
lists of all country names
3
, of the capitals of these
countries
4
, of the fifty U.S. states, and of all cities in the
United States with more than 25,000 people
5
. We then compare
the words in each text document with the database of
location names, and output any matching entries and their
count per document. This matching is case insensitive, because
we found capitalization of location names in web pages
to be erratic. Note that we do not attempt to disambiguate
words that match location names but also have other senses
(e.g., "China"), as this is a hard problem in natural language
analysis; instead, we count such words as locations. An alternative
approach that would detect and disambiguate location
names would be to use a named-entity tagger. We
experimented with a well-known third-party named-entity
tagger, but we encountered a very high error rate because
of the noise often introduced in web pages.
Our classification features combine these location counts
in various ways. For each query, we measure the average

(per returned web page) number of location words in the retrieved
results. We count the average frequency of location
words at different levels of detail (country, state, city), as
well as the average of the aggregate total for all locations.
We obtain these frequencies for both the total count (tokens)
and the unique location words in each page (types), as it is
possible that a few locations would be repeated many times
across the results, indicating a global query, or that many locations
would be repeated few times each, indicating a local
query. We also consider the total number of unique locations
across all the returned documents taken together, divided by
the number of retrieved documents. For the average token
frequencies of city, state, and country locations we also calculate
the minimum and maximum across the set of returned
web pages. To account for the hierarchical nature of location
information, we calculate an alternative frequency for states
where we include in the count for each state the counts for
all cities from that state that were found in that text; this
allows us to group together location information for cities
in the same state. We also include some distributional measures
, namely the fraction of the pages that include at least
one location of any kind, the percentage of words that match
locations across all pages, and the standard deviation of the
total per page location count. Finally, we add to our list
of features the total number of words in all of the returned
documents, to explore any effect the local/global distinction
may have on the size of the returned documents. These calculations
provide for 20 distinct features that are passed on
to the classifier.
6
The core data needed to produce these
20 query features (i.e., the locations mentioned in each web
page) could be efficiently computed by a search engine such
as Google at page-indexing time. Then, the final feature
computation could be quickly performed at query time using
this core data.
4.2
Classification Methods
We initially trained a classifier using
Ripper [8], which
constructs a rule-based classifier in an incremental manner.
The algorithm creates an initial set of very specific rules
based on the data, similar to the way in which decision trees
are generated. The rules are then pruned iteratively to eliminate
the ones that do not seem to be valid for a large enough
subset of the training data, so as to prevent overfitting.
Although
Ripper provides a robust classifier with high
accuracy and transparency (a human can easily examine
the produced rules), it outputs binary "local"­"global" decisions
. In many cases, it is preferable to obtain a measure
of confidence in the result or an estimate of the probability
that the assigned class is the correct one. To add this capability
to our classifier, we experimented with logistic regression
[19]. Logistic, or log-linear, regression models a binary
output variable (the class) as a function of a weighted sum
of several input variables (the classification features). Con-ceptually
, a linear predictor
is first fitted over the training
data in a manner identical to regular regression analysis,

that feature during training. Subsequently,

to the final response,
C, via the logistic transformation
C =

which guarantees that
C is between 0 and 1. Each of the
endpoints of the interval (0
, 1) is associated with one of the
classes, and
C gives the probability that the correct class is
the one associated with "1". In practice, the calculations are
not performed as a separate regression and transformation,
but rather as a series of successive regressions of transformed
variables via the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm
[1].
7
We used the implementation of log-linear regression
provided in the R statistical package.
8
Another desideratum for our classifier is its ability to support
different costs for the two possible kinds of errors (misclassifying
local queries versus misclassifying global queries).
Which kind of error is the most important may vary for
different settings; for our search modification application,
we consider the misclassification of global queries as local
ones a more serious error. This is because during our subsequent
modification of the returned results (Section 6), we
reorder the results for some of the queries that we consider
global, but we modify the original queries for some of the
queries classified as local, returning potentially very different
results. Consequently, the results can change more significantly
for a query classified as local, and the potential for
error is higher when a global query is labeled local than the
other way around.
Both
Ripper and log-linear regression can incorporate different
costs for each type of error. We experimented with
a third classification approach that also supports this feature
, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [2], which have been
found quite effective for text matching problems [11]. SVM
classifiers conceptually convert the original measurements of
the features in the data to points in a high-dimensional space
that facilitates the separation between the two classes more
than the original representation. While the transformation
between the original and the high-dimensional space may be
complex, it needs not to be carried out explicitly. Instead,
it is sufficient to calculate a kernel function that only involves
dot products between the transformed data points,
and can be calculated directly in the original feature space.
We report experiments with two of the most common kernel
functions: a linear kernel,
K(x, y) = x · y + 1
and a Gaussian (radial basis function) kernel,
K(x, y) = e
- x-y
2
/2
2
where
is a parameter (representing the standard deviation
of the underlying distribution). This latter kernel has been
recommended for text matching tasks [10]. Regardless of the
choice of kernel, determining the optimal classifier is equivalent
to determining the hyperplane that maximizes the total
distance between itself and representative transformed data
points (the support vectors).
Finding the optimal classifier
therefore becomes a constrained quadratic optimization
7
This is because the modeled distribution is binomial rather
than normal, and hence the variance depends on the mean-see
[19] for the technical details.

problem. In our experiments, we use the SVM-Light implementation
9
[12].
In many binary classification tasks, one of the two classes
predominates, and thus trained classifiers tend to favor that
class in the absence of strong evidence to the contrary. This
certainly applies to our task; as we show in Section 5.1,
83­89% of web queries are global. Weiss and Provost [21]
showed that this imbalance can lead to inferior classifier
performance on the test set, and that the problem can be
addressed through oversampling of the rarer class in the
training data. Their method examines different oversampling
rates by constructing artificial training sets where the
smaller class is randomly oversampled to achieve a specific
ratio between samples from the two classes. For each such
sampling ratio, a classifier is trained, which assigns a score
to each object indicating strength of evidence for one of the
classes. By fixing a specific strength threshold, we divide
the classifier output into the two classes. Further, by varying
this threshold
10
we can obtain an error-rate curve for
each class as a function of the threshold. The entire process
results in a Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve
[3] for each sampling ratio. Specific points on the curve that
optimize the desired combination of error rates can then be
selected, and the performance of the classification method
across the different thresholds can be measured from the
area between the curve and the x-axis. Weiss and Provost
use the C4.5 classifier [17], a decision tree classifier with
additional pruning of nodes to avoid overfitting. We use a
software package provided by them (and consequently also
the C4.5 algorithm) to explore the effect that different ratios
of global to local queries during training have on classifier
performance.

<SECTION header="EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS">We now describe the data (Section 5.1) and metrics (Section
5.2) that we use for the experimental evaluation of the
query classifiers (Section 5.3).
5.1
Data
For the experiments reported in this paper, we used a sample
of real queries submitted to the Excite search engine.
11
We had access to a portion of the December 1999 query log of
Excite, containing 2,477,283 queries. We randomly selected
initial sets of queries for training, development (tuning the
parameters of the classifiers we train), and testing purposes
by selecting each of these queries for inclusion in each set
with a constant (very small) probability. These probabilities
were set to 400/2,477,283, 400/2,477,283, and 500/2,477,283

Setting the threshold to each extreme assigns all or none
of the data points to that category.

http://www.excite.com/
for the three sets, respectively. Subsequently we combined
the training and development set, and reassigned the queries
in the combined set so that three-fourths were placed in the
training set and one-fourth in the development; we kept the
test set separate. This process generated 595, 199, and 497
queries in the initial versions of the training, development,
and test sets. We further eliminated queries that passed any
of the following tests:
· Upon examination, they appeared likely to produce
results with explicit sexual content.
· When supplied to Google--and after filtering out any
non-HTML results and any broken links--the queries
produced fewer than 40 files. This constraint is meant
to ensure that we are not including in our experimental
data queries that contain misspellings or deal with
extremely esoteric subjects, for which not enough material
for determining locality would be available.
· They had already been included in an earlier set (we
constructed first the training set, then the development
set, and finally the test set). Since multiple people
may issue the same query, duplicates can be found
in the log. Although our algorithms take no special advantage
of duplicates, we eliminated them to avoid any
bias. Taking into account variations of upper/lower
case and spacing between queries (but not word order
), this constraint removed 6 queries from the test
set.
These filtering steps left us with 439 queries in the training
set, 148 queries in the development set, and 379 queries in
the test set.
We then classified the queries using the criteria laid out
in Section 3. Table 1 shows the size of the three sets before
and after filtering, and the distribution of local and global
queries in each set. We observe that, in general, most queries
(83­89%) tend to be global.
5.2
Evaluation Metrics
We consider a number of evaluation metrics to rate the
performance of the various classifiers and their configurations
. Since a large majority of the queries are global (85.6%
in the training, development, and test sets combined), overall
classification accuracy (i.e., the percentage of correct
classification decisions) may not be the most appropriate
measure. This is because a baseline method that always
suggests the most populous class ("global") will have an accuracy
equal to the proportion of global queries in the evaluated
set. Yet such a classifier will offer no improvement
during search since it provides no new information. The situation
is analogous to applications in information retrieval
or medicine where very few of the samples should be labeled
positive (e.g., in a test for a disease that affects only 0.1%
329
of patients). While we do not want overall accuracy to decrease
from the baseline (at least not significantly), we will
utilize measures that capture the classifier's improved ability
to detect the rarer class relative to the baseline method.
Two standard such metrics are precision and recall for
the local queries. Precision is the ratio of the number of
items correctly assigned to the class divided by the total
number of items assigned to the class. Recall is the ratio
of the number of items correctly assigned to a class as compared
with the total number of items in the class. Note that
the baseline method achieves precision of 100% but recall of
0%. For a given classifier with adjustable parameters, often
precision can be increased at the expense of recall, and vice
versa; therefore we also compute the F-measure [20] (with
equal weights) to combine precision and recall into a single
number,
F-measure = 2 × Precision × Recall
Precision + Recall
Finally, we argued earlier that one kind of misclassification
errors may be assigned a higher cost. We can then calculate
the average cost [15],
Average cost =
X{
Global
,
Local
}
Cost(
X) × Rate(X)
where Cost(
X) is the cost of wrong X classifications and
Rate(
X) is the rate of wrong X classifications. Average cost
is the measure to minimize from a decision theory perspective
. The rate of wrong classifications for a class is equal
to the number of data points that have been misclassified
into that class divided by the total number of classification
decisions, and the costs for each misclassification error are
predetermined parameters. If both costs are set to 1, then
the average cost becomes equal to the total error rate, i.e.,
one minus accuracy. In our experiments, we report the average
cost considering the mislabeling of global queries as
local twice as important as the mislabeling of local queries,
for the reasons explained in the previous section.
5.3
Results
We trained the classifiers of Section 4.2 on the 439 queries
in our training set.
Ripper and the regression model were
trained on that training set without modification. For C4.5
and SVMs, we explored the effect that different proportions
of local queries in the training set have on overall performance
. For that purpose, we used our development set to
evaluate the performance effects of different local query proportions
, and select the optimal classifier within each family.
For the C4.5-based classifier, we used the C4.4 software
provided by Foster Provost and Claudia Perlich to explore
the effect of different proportions of local and global queries.
We created training sets by randomly oversampling or un-dersampling
the minority (local) class as needed, in increments
of 10%.
For any given proportion of local queries
between 10% and 90%, we started from our training set,
modified it according to the above sampling method to have
the desired proportion of local queries, trained the corresponding
C4.5 classifier, and evaluated its performance on
our development set. The natural proportion of the local
class in the unmodified training data is also included as one
of the proportions used to build and evaluate a classifier. In
this manner, we obtain curves for the various metrics as the
proportion of local queries varies (Figure 1). We observe
Figure 1:

that the highest value for precision and F-measure, and the
lowest value for the average cost, are obtained when the
classifier is trained with a significantly amplified proportion
of local queries (80%). Further, running C4.5 with 80% local
queries also produced the largest area under the ROC
curve obtained when different precision/recall tradeoffs in
the development set are explored. On the basis of this information
, we selected the proportion of 80% local queries
as the optimal configuration for C4.5. We refer to that configuration
as C4.5(80), and this is the version of C4.5 that
we evaluated on the test set.
Using our own implementation for constructing extended
training sets with a given proportion of local queries, we
performed similar experiments for Support Vector Machines
with linear and Gaussian kernels. For these classifiers, we
also experimented with versions trained with equal error
costs for the two kinds of classification errors, and with versions
where, during training, a false local assignment counts
for twice as much as a false global assignment. We found
that the optimal proportion of local queries is closer to the
natural proportion with SVMs compared to C4.5 classifiers;
the proportions chosen from our development set were 50%
for the linear SVM classifier with equal error costs, 30% for
the linear SVM classifier with unequal error costs, 30% for
the Gaussian SVM classifier with equal error costs, and 20%
for the Gaussian SVM classifier with unequal error costs.
We denote the optimal classifiers from these four families
as SVM-Linear-E(50), SVM-Linear-U(30), SVM-Gaussian-E
(30), and SVM-Gaussian-U(20), respectively.
Figure 2
shows the curve obtained for the SVM-Gaussian-U family
of classifiers.
Having determined the best value for the proportion of
local queries for C4.5 and SVM-based classifiers, we evaluate
these classifiers, as well as the classifiers obtained from
Ripper and log-linear regression, on our test set.

with unequal error costs achieves the highest F-measure,

We also experimented with variable error costs for the

but the resulting classifier was identical to the

while the log-linear classifier achieves the lowest average
classification cost. As expected, the SVM classifiers that
were trained with unequal error costs achieve the same or
lower average cost (which also utilizes the same unequal error
costs) compared to their counterparts trained with equal
error costs. Overall,
Ripper, log-linear regression, and the
two SVM classifiers with linear kernels achieve the highest
performance, with small differences between them. They
are followed by the two SVM classifiers with a Gaussian
kernel function, while C4.5 trails significantly behind the
other classifiers.
The features used for classification vary considerably from
classifier to classifier.
13
Ripper achieves one of the best classification
performances using only one simple rule, based
only on the average number of city locations per returned
web page: if that number exceeds a threshold, the query is
classified as local, otherwise as global. On the other hand,
the C4.5 and SVM classifiers utilize all or almost all the
features. The log-linear regression classifier falls in-between
these two extremes, and primarily utilizes the average numbers
of unique city, state, and country names per retrieved
page, as well as the total number of unique locations per
page (4 features).
For concreteness, and to conclude our discussion, Table 3

shows the performance of our classifiers on a few representative
examples of local and global queries.

<SECTION header="IMPROVING SEARCH RESULTS">The core of this paper is on classifying queries as either
local or global. In this section, we present preliminary ideas
on how to exploit this classification to improve the quality
of the query results. Further exploration of these and other
directions is the subject of interesting future work.
Consider a query that has been classified as local using
the techniques of Section 4.
By definition, this query is
best answered with "localized" pages. We can easily determine
if the query includes any location name by using the
dictionary-based approach of Section 4.1. If no locations are
present in the query (e.g., as in query [houses for sale]), in
the absence of further information we can attempt to "localize"
the query results to the geographical area of the user
issuing the query, for which we can rely on registration information
provided by the user, for example. Consequently,
we can simply expand the query by appending the user's
location to it, to turn, say, the query [houses for sale] into
[houses for sale San Francisco] for a San Francisco resident.
Alternatively, a search engine might attempt to obtain additional
information from the user to further localize the query
as appropriate. For example, the query [houses for sale] can
then be transformed into [houses for sale New York City] for
a San Francisco resident who is moving to New York City. In
either case, the expanded query will tend to produce much
more focused and localized results than the original query
does. As of the writing of this paper, all of the top-10 results
returned by Google for query [houses for sale San Francisco]
are results of relevance to a person interested in Bay Area
real estate. In contrast, most of the results for the original
query, [houses for sale], are irrelevant to such a person, as
discussed in the Introduction. An alternative, more expensive
strategy for handling these queries is to compute and
exploit the geographical scope of web pages as defined in [9].
Then, pages with a geographical scope that includes the location
of the user issuing the query would be preferred over
other pages. In contrast, a local query in which locations are
mentioned is likely to return pages with the right locality,
making any further modification of the query or reranking
of the results unnecessary.
Consider now a query that has been classified as global
using the techniques of Section 4. By definition, this query
is best answered with "broad" pages. Rather than attempting
to modify a global query so that it returns "broad"
pages, we can follow a result reranking strategy to privilege
these pages over more localized ones. One possible reranking
strategy is to reorder the results from, say, Google for

Table 3: Classification assignments made by different classifiers on several example queries. SVM-LE, SVM-LU
, SVM-GE, and SVM-GU stand for classifiers SVM-Linear-E(50), SVM-Linear-U(30), SVM-Gaussian-E
(30), and SVM-Gaussian-U(20), respectively. For regression and SVM classifiers, positive numbers indicate
assignment to the local class, and negative numbers indicate assignment to the global class; the absolute
magnitude of the numbers increases as the classifier's confidence in its decision increases.
(We linearly
transformed the regression output from the (0, 1) to the (
-1, 1) range.) The scale of the numbers is
consistent across queries and between all SVM classifiers, but not directly comparable between regression
classifiers (bound between
-1 and 1) and SVM classifiers (unbounded).
the unmodified query based on the geographical scope of the
pages as defined in [9]. Thus pages with a broad geographical
scope (e.g., covering the entire United States) would
prevail over other pages with a narrower scope. A less expensive
alternative is to classify the result pages as local
or global following a procedure similar to that of Section 4
for queries.
Specifically, we implemented this alternative
by training C4.5
Rules, a rule-based version of the C4.5
decision-tree classifier, with a collection of 140 web pages
categorized in the Yahoo! directory. Pages classified under
individual states in the "Regional" portion of the directory
were regarded as local, while pages under general categories
were regarded as global. The feature representation for the
pages was analogous to that for the queries in Section 4.1
but restricted to features that are meaningful over individual
pages (e.g., total number of locations on a page), as opposed
to over a collection of pages (e.g., minimum number of locations
per page in the top-50 result pages for a query). At
query time, we reorder the results so as to privilege global
pages over local ones. This is based on the locality classification
of the pages, which can be precomputed off-line since
it is query-independent or performed on the fly as we do in
our prototype implementation. This procedure is efficient,
and produced promising initial results for a handful of global
queries (e.g., [wildflowers]) that we tried.
Our preliminary approach to query modification is therefore
as follows: Given a query specified by the user, we supply
first the unmodified query to the search engine and collect
the top 50 results.
We extract location names from
these results
14
, and calculate the features of Section 4.1.
Using one of the best performing classifiers of Section 4, we
determine if the query is global or local. If it is local and

contains at least one location name, nothing is done--the
results returned from the unmodified query are presented
to the user. If the query is local and contains no location,
we add the user's location (or, alternatively, request further
information from the user, as discussed), reissue the query
and present the results. Finally, if the query is global, we
calculate the scope of each retrieved web page using part of
the location features computed earlier and the C4.5
Rules
classifier, and rerank the results so that more global pages
are higher in the list shown to the user. We have built a prototype
implementation of this algorithm, using the classifier
obtained from
Ripper (because of the relative simplicity of
its rules) for query classification, and Google as the search
engine.
</SECTION>
<SECTION header="CONCLUSION">We have described an attribute of queries, locality, that-to
the best of our knowledge--has not been explored before
either in theoretical work or in practical search engines but
can significantly affect the appropriateness of the results
returned to the user. We defined a categorization scheme
for queries based on their geographical locality, and showed
how queries can be represented for purposes of determining
locality by features based on location names found in the
results they produce. Using these features, automatic classifiers
for determining locality can be built. We explored
several state-of-the-art classification approaches, and evaluated
their performance on a large set of actual queries. The
empirical results indicated that for many queries locality can
be determined effectively.
The bulk of the paper discussed methods for classifying
queries according to locality, and empirically established
that this is desirable and feasible for many queries.
We
also presented some first thoughts on possible query refor-332
mulation and result reranking strategies that utilize locality
information to actually improve the results the user sees.
Although our strategies for query modification and result
reranking are preliminary, they illustrate a promising family
of approaches that we plan to investigate in the future
so that we can exploit the classification of queries based on
their geographical locality in order to improve search result
quality.
