<SECTION header="ABSTRACT">A collaborative crawler is a group of crawling nodes, in
which each crawling node is responsible for a specific portion
of the web. We study the problem of collecting geographically
-aware pages using collaborative crawling strategies. We
first propose several collaborative crawling strategies for the
geographically focused crawling, whose goal is to collect web
pages about specified geographic locations, by considering
features like URL address of page, content of page, extended
anchor text of link, and others. Later, we propose various
evaluation criteria to qualify the performance of such
crawling strategies. Finally, we experimentally study our
crawling strategies by crawling the real web data showing
that some of our crawling strategies greatly outperform the
simple URL-hash based partition collaborative crawling, in
which the crawling assignments are determined according
to the hash-value computation over URLs. More precisely,
features like URL address of page and extended anchor text
of link are shown to yield the best overall performance for
the geographically focused crawling.

<SECTION header="INTRODUCTION">While most of the current search engines are effective for
pure keyword-oriented searches, these search engines are not
fully effective for geographic-oriented keyword searches. For
instance, queries like "restaurants in New York, NY" or
"good plumbers near 100 milam street, Houston, TX" or
"romantic hotels in Las Vegas, NV" are not properly man-aged
by traditional web search engines. Therefore, in recent

years, there has been surge of interest within the search
industry on the search localization (e.g., Google Local
1
, Yahoo
Local
2
). The main aim of such search localization is
to allow the user to perform the search according his/her
keyword input as well as the geographic location of his/her
interest.
Due to the current size of the Web and its dynamical nature
, building a large scale search engine is challenging and
it is still active area of research. For instance, the design
of efficient crawling strategies and policies have been exten-sively
studied in recent years (see [9] for the overview of the
field). While it is possible to build geographically sensitive
search engines using the full web data collected through a
standard web crawling, it would rather be more attractive
to build such search engines over a more focused web data
collection which are only relevant to the targeted geographic
locations. Focusing on the collection of web pages which are
relevant to the targeted geographic location would leverage
the overall processing time and efforts for building such
search engines. For instance, if we want to build a search
engine targeting those users in New York, NY, then we can
build it using the web collection, only relevant to the city
of New York, NY. Therefore, given intended geographic regions
for crawling, we refer the task of collecting web pages,
relevant to the intended geographic regions as geographically
focused crawling.
The idea of focusing on a particular portion of the web
for crawling is not novel. For instance, the design of efficient
topic-oriented or domain-oriented crawling strategies
has been previously studied [8, 23, 24]. However, there has
been little previous work on incorporating the geographical
dimension of web pages to the crawling. In this paper,
we study various aspects of crawling when the geographical
dimension is considered.
While the basic idea behind the standard crawling is straightforward
, the collaborative crawling or parallel crawling is often
used due to the performance and scalability issues that
might arise during the real crawling of the web [12, 19].
In a collaborative or parallel crawler, the multiple crawling
nodes are run in parallel on a multiprocessor or in a distributed
manner to maximize the download speed and to further
improve the overall performance especially for the scalability
of crawling. Therefore, we study the geographically
focused crawling under the collaborative setting, in which
the targeted geographic regions are divided and then assigned
to each participating crawling node. More precisely,

in a geographically focused collaborative crawler, there will
be a set of geographically focused crawling nodes in which
each node is only responsible for collecting those web pages,
relevant to its assigned geographic regions. Furthermore,
there will be additional set of general crawling nodes which
aim to support other geographically focused crawling nodes
through the general crawling (download of pages which are
not geographically-aware). The main contributions of our
paper are follows:
1. We propose several geographically focused collaborative
crawling strategies whose goal is to collect web
pages about the specified geographic regions.
2. We propose several evaluation criteria for measuring
the performance of a geographically focused crawling
strategy.
3. We empirically study our proposed crawling strategies
by crawling the real web. More specifically, we collect
web pages pertinent to the top 100 US cities for each
crawling strategy.
4. We empirically study geographic locality.
That is, pages
which are geographically related are more likely to be
linked compared to those which are not.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we introduce some of the previous works related to
our geographically focused collaborative crawling. In Section
3, we describe the problem of geographically focused
collaborative crawling and then we propose several crawling
policies to deal with this type of crawling. In Section 4,
we present evaluation models to measure the performance
of a geographically focused collaborative crawling strategy.
In Section 5, we present results of our experiments with the
real web data. Finally, in Section 6, we present final remarks
about our work.

<SECTION header="RELATED WORKS">A focused crawler is designed to only collect web pages
on a specified topic while transversing the web. The basic
idea of a focused crawler is to optimize the priority of the
unvisited URLs on the crawler frontier so that pages concerning
a particular topic are retrieved earlier. Bra et al. [4]
propose a focused web crawling method in the context of a
client-based real-time search engine. Its crawling strategy is
based on the intuition that relevant pages on the topic likely
contain links to other pages on the same topic. Thus, the
crawler follows more links from relevant pages which are estimated
by a binary classifier that uses keyword and regular
expression matchings. In spite of its reasonably acceptable
performance, it has an important drawback as a relevant
page on the topic might be hardly reachable when this page
is not pointed by pages relevant to the topic.
Cho et al. [11] propose several strategies for prioritiz-ing
unvisited URLs based on the pages downloaded so far.
In contrast to other focused crawlers in which a supervised
topic classifier is used to control the way that crawler handles
the priority of pages to be be downloaded, their strategies
are based on considering some simple properties such as
linkage or keyword information to define the priority of pages
to be downloaded. They conclude that determining the priority
of pages to be downloaded based on their PageRank
value yield the best overall crawling performance.
Chakrabarti et al. [8] propose another type of focused
crawler architecture which is composed of three components,
namely classifier, distiller and crawler. The classifier makes
the decision on the page relevancy to determine its future
link expansion. The distiller identifies those hub pages, as
defined in [20], pointing to many topic related pages to determine
the priority of pages to be visited. Finally, the crawling
module fetches pages using the list of pages provided by the
distiller. In the subsequent work, Chakrabarti et al. [7]
suggest that only a fraction of URLs extracted from a page
are worth following. They claim that a crawler can avoid
irrelevant links if the relevancy of links can be determined
by the local text surrounding it. They propose alternative
focused crawler architecture where documents are modeled
as tag trees using DOM (Document Object Model). In their
crawler, two classifiers are used, namely the "baseline" and
the "apprentice". The baseline classifier refers to the module
that navigates through the web to obtain the enriching
training data for the apprentice classifier. The apprentice
classifier, on the other hand, is trained over the data collected
through the baseline classifier and eventually guides
the overall crawling by determining the relevancy of links
using the contextual information around them.
Diligenti et al. [14] use the context graph to improve
the baseline best-first focused crawling method. In their
approach, there is a classifier which is trained through the
features extracted from the paths that lead to the relevant
pages. They claim that there is some chance that some off-topic
pages might potentially lead to highly relevant pages.
Therefore, in order to mediate the hardness of identifying
apparently off-topic pages, they propose the usage of context
graph to guide the crawling. More precisely, first a
context graph for seed pages is built using links to the pages
returned from a search engine. Next, the context graph is
used to train a set of classifiers to assign documents to different
categories using their estimated distance, based on
the number of links, to relevant pages on different categories
. Their experimental results reveal that the context
graph based focused crawler has a better performance and
achieves higher relevancy compared to an ordinary best-first
crawler.
Cho et al. [10] attempt to map and explore a full design
space for parallel and distributed crawlers. Their work
addresses issues of communication bandwidth, page quality
and the division of work between local crawlers. Later,
Chung et al. [12] study parallel or distributed crawling in
the context of topic-oriented crawling. Basically, in their
topic-oriented collaborative crawler, each crawling node is
responsible for a particular set of topics and the page is
assigned to the crawling node which is responsible for the
topic which the page is relevant to. To determine the topic of
page, a simple Naive-Bayes classifier is employed. Recently,
Exposto et al. [17] study distributed crawling by means of
the geographical partition of the web considering the multi-level
partitioning of the reduced IP web link graph. Note
that our IP-based collaborative crawling strategy is similar
to their approach in spirit as we consider the IP-addresses
related to the given web pages to distribute them among
participating crawling nodes.
Gravano and his collaborators study the geographically-aware
search problem in various works [15, 18, 5]. Particularly
, in [15], how to compute the geographical scope of web
resources is discussed. In their work, linkage and seman-288
tic information are used to assess the geographical scope of
web resources. Their basic idea is as follows. If a reasonable
number of links pertinent to one particular geographic location
point to a web resource and these links are smoothly
distributed across the location, then this location is treated
as one of the geographic scopes of the corresponding web
resource. Similarly, if a reasonable number of location references
is found within a web resource, and the location references
are smoothly distributed across the location, then this
location is treated as one of the geographical scopes of the
web resource. They also propose how to solve aliasing and
ambiguity. Recently,
Markowetz et al. [22] propose the design
and the initial implementation of a geographic search
engine prototype for Germany. Their prototype extracts
various geographic features from the crawled web dataset
consisting of pages whose domain name contains "de". A
geographic footprint, a set of relevant locations for page, is
assigned to each page. Subsequently, the resulting footprint
is integrated into the query processor of the search engine.
</SECTION>
<SECTION header="CRAWLING">Even though, in theory, the targeted geographic locations
of a geographically focused crawling can be any valid geographic
location, in our paper, a geographic location refers
to a city-state pair for the sake of simplicity. Therefore,
given a list of city-state pairs, the goal of our geographically
focused crawling is to collect web pages which are "relevant"
to the targeted city-state pairs. Thus, after splitting and
distributing the targeted city-state pairs to the participating
crawling nodes, each participating crawling node would
be responsible for the crawling of web pages relevant to its
assigned city-state pairs.
Example 1. Given {(New York, NY), (Houston, TX)}
as the targeted city-state pairs and 3 crawling nodes {Cn
1
,
Cn
2
, Cn
3
}, one possible design of geographically focused collaborative
crawler is to assign (New York, NY) to Cn
1
and
(Houston, TX) to Cn
2
.
Particularly, for our experiments, we perform the geographically
focused crawling of pages targeting the top 100
US cities, which will be explained later in Section 5. We
use some general notations to denote the targeted city-state
pairs and crawling nodes as follows. Let T C = {(c
1
, s
1
),
. . . , (c
n
, s
n
)} denote the set of targeted city-state pairs for
our crawling where each (c
i
, s
i
) is a city-state pair. When
it is clear in the context, we will simply denote (c
i
, s
i
) as c
i
.
Let CR = {Cn
1
, . . . , Cn
m
} denote the set of participating
crawling nodes for our crawling. The main challenges that
have to be dealt by a geographically focused collaborative
crawler are the following:
· How to split and then distribute T C = {c
1
, . . . , c
n
}
among the participating CR = {Cn
1
, . . . , Cn

}
· Given a retrieved page p, based on what criteria we
assign the extracted URLs from p to the participating
crawling nodes.

Figure 1: Exchange of the extracted URLs
3.2
Assignment of the extracted URLs
When a crawling node extracts the URLs from a given
page, it has to decide whether to keep the URLs for itself
or transfer them to other participating crawling nodes for
further fetching of the URLs. Once the URL is assigned to
a particular crawling node, it may be added to the node's
pending queue. Given a retrieved page p, let pr(c
i
|p) be
the probability that page p is about the city-state pair c
i
.
Suppose that the targeted city-state pairs are given and they
are distributed over the participating crawling nodes. There
are mainly two possible policies for the exchange of URLs
between crawling nodes.
· Policy A: Given the retrieved page p, let c
i
be the
most probable city-state pair about p, i.e. arg max
c

T C
pr(c

Lemma 2. Let b be the bandwidth cost and let c be the
inter-communication cost between crawling nodes. If b &gt; c,
then the Policy A is more cost effective than the Policy B.
Proof:
Given an extracted URL q from page p, let m be
the number of crawling nodes used by the Policy B (crawling
nodes which are assigned to download q). Since the cost for
the policy A and B is equal when m = 1, we suppose m  2.
Let l be the total number of URLs extracted from q. Let
C(A) and C(B) be the sum of total inter-communication
cost plus the bandwidth cost for the Policy A and Policy B
respectively. One can easily verify that the cost of download
for q and all URLs extracted from q is given as C(A) 
b+l·(c+b) as shown in Figure 1a) and C(B)  m·b+l·m·b.
289
as shown in Figure 1b). Therefore, it follows that C(A) 
C(B) since m  2 and b &gt; c.
The assignment of extracted URLs for each retrieved page
of all crawling collaboration strategies that we consider next
will be based on the Policy A.
3.3
Hash Based Collaboration
We consider the hash based collaboration, which is the approach
taken by most of collaborative crawlers, for the sake
of comparison of this basic approach to our geographically
focused collaboration strategies. The goal of hash based collaboration
is to implementing a distributed crawler partition
over the web by computing hash functions over URLs. When
a crawling node extracts a URL from the retrieved page, a
hash function is then computed over the URL. The URL is
assigned to the participating crawling node responsible for
the corresponding hash value of the URL. Since we are using
a uniform hash function for our experiments, we will have
a considerable data exchange between crawling nodes since
the uniform hash function will map most of URLs extracted
from the retrieved page to remote crawling nodes.
3.4
Geographically Focused Collaborations
We first divide up CR, the set of participating crawling
nodes, into geographically sensitive nodes and general nodes.
Even though, any combination of geographically sensitive
and general crawling nodes is allowed, the architecture of
our crawler consists of five geographically sensitive and one
general crawling node for our experiments. A geographically
sensitive crawling node will be responsible for the download
of pages pertinent to a subset targeted city-state pairs while
a general crawling node will be responsible for the download
of pages which are not geographically-aware supporting
other geographically sensitive nodes.
Each collaboration policy considers a particular set of features
for the assessment of the geographical scope of page
(whether a page is pertinent to a particular city-state pair
or not). From the result of this assessment, each extracted
URL from the page will be assigned to the crawling node
that is responsible for the download of pages pertinent to
the corresponding city-state pair.
3.4.1
URL Based
The intuition behind the URL based collaboration is that
pages containing a targeted city-state pair in their URL address
might potentially guide the crawler toward other pages
about the city-state pair. More specifically, for each extracted
URL from the retrieved page p, we verify whether
the city-state pair c
i
is found somewhere in the URL address
of the extracted URL. If the city-state pair c
i
is found,
then we assign the corresponding URL to the crawling node
which is responsible for the download of pages about c
i
.
3.4.2
Extended Anchor Text Based
Given link text l, an extended anchor text of l is defined
as the set of prefix and suffix tokens of l of certain size. It is
known that extended anchor text provides valuable information
to characterize the nature of the page which is pointed
by link text. Therefore, for the extended anchor text based
collaboration, our assumption is that pages associated with
the extended anchor text, in which a targeted city-state pair
c
i
is found, will lead the crawler toward those pages about
c
i
. More precisely, given retrieved page p, and the extended
anchor text l found somewhere in p, we verify whether the
city-state pair c
i
T C is found as part of the extended
anchor text l. When multiple findings of city-state occurs,
then we choose the city-state pair that is the closest to the
link text. Finally, we assign the URL associated with l to
the crawling node that is responsible for the download of
pages about c
i
.
3.4.3
Full Content Based
In [15], the location reference is used to assess the geographical
scope of page. Therefore, for the full content
based collaboration, we perform a content analysis of the
retrieved page to guide the crawler for the future link expansion
. Let pr((c
i
, s
i
)|p) be the probability that page p
is about city-state pair (c
i
, s
i
). Given T C and page p, we
compute pr((c
i
, s
i
)|p) for (c
i
, s
i
)  T C as follows:
pr((c
i
, s
i
)|p) =  · #((c
i
, s
i
), p) + (1 - ) · pr(s
i
|c
i
) · #(c
i
, p)
(1)
where #((c
i
, s
i
), p) denotes the number of times that the
city-state pair (c
i
, s
i
) is found as part of the content of
p, #(c
i
, p) denotes the number of times (independent of
#((c
i
, s
i
), p)) that the city reference c
i
is found as part of
the content of p, and  denotes the weighting factor. For
our experiments,  = 0.7 was used.
The probability pr(s
i
|c
i
) is calculated under two simplified
assumptions: (1) pr(s
i
|c
i
) is dependent on the real population
size of (c
i
, s
i
) (e.g., Population of Kansas City, Kansas
is 500,000). We obtain the population size for each city
city-data.com
3
. (2) pr(s
i
|c
i
) is dependent on the number
of times that the state reference is found (independent of
#((c
i
, s
i
), p)) as part of the content of p. In other words,
our assumption for pr(s
j
|c
i
) can be written as
pr(s
i
|c
i
)  S(s
i
|c
i
) + (1 - ) ~
S(s
i
|p)
(2)
where S(s
i
|c
i
) is the normalized form of the population
size of (c
i
, s
i
), ~
S(s
i
|p) is the normalized form of the number
of appearances of the state reference s
i
, independent of
#((c
i
, s
i
), p)), within the content of p, and  denotes the
weighting factor. For our experiments,  = 0.5 was used.
Therefore, pr((c
i
, s
i
)|p) is computed as
pr((c
i
, s
i
)|p)
=  · #((c
i
, s
i
), p) + (1 - ) · (S(s
i
|c
i
)
+ (1 - ) ~
S(s
i
|p)) · #(c
i
, p)
(3)
Finally, given a retrieve page p, we assign all extracted
URLs from p to the crawling node which is responsible for
pages relevant to arg max

P r((c

, s

3.4.4
Classification Based
Chung et al. [12] show that the classification based collaboration
yields a good performance for the topic-oriented
collaborative crawling. Our classification based collaboration
for the geographically crawling is motivated by their
work. In this type of collaboration, the classes for the classifier
are the partitions of targeted city-state pairs. We train
our classifier to determine pr(c
i
|p), the probability that the
retrieved page p is pertinent to the city-state pair c
i
. Among
various possible classification methods, we chose the Naive-Bayes
classifier [25] due to its simplicity. To obtain training
3
http://www.city-data.com
290
data, pages from the Open Directory Project (ODP)
4
were
used. For each targeted city-state pair, we download all
pages under the corresponding city-state category which, in
turn, is the child category for the "REGIONAL" category
in the ODP. The number of pages downloaded for each city-state
pair varied from 500 to 2000. We also download a set of
randomly chosen pages which are not part of any city-state
category in the ODP. We download 2000 pages for this purpose
. Then, we train our Naive-Bayes classifier using these
training data. Our classifier determines whether a page p
is pertinent to either of the targeted city-state pairs or it is
not relevant to any city-state pair at all. Given the retrieved
page p, we assign all extracted URLs from p to the crawling
node which is responsible for the download of pages which
are pertinent to arg max
c
i

T C
pr(c
i
|p).
3.4.5
IP-Address Based
The IP-address of the web service indicates the geographic
location at which the web service is hosted. The IP-address
based collaboration explores this information to control the
behavior of the crawler for further downloads. Given a retrieved
page p, we first determine the IP-address of the web
service from which the crawler downloaded p. With this IP-address
, we use the IP-address mapping tool to obtain the
corresponding city-state pair of the given IP, and then we assign
all extracted URLs of page p to the crawling node which
is responsible on the computed city-state pair. For the IP-address
mapping tool, freely available IP address mapping
tool, hostip.info(API)
5
is employed.
3.5
Normalization and Disambiguation of City
Names
As indicated in [2, 15], problems of aliasing and ambiguity
arise when one wants to map the possible city-state reference
candidate to an unambiguous city-state pair. In this section,
we describe how we handle these issues out.
· Aliasing: Many times different names or abbreviations
are used for the same city name. For example,
Los Angeles can be also referred as LA or L.A. Similar
to [15], we used the web database of the United
States Postal Service (USPS)
6
to deal with aliasing.
The service returns a list of variations of the corresponding
city name given the zip code. Thus, we first
obtained the list of representative zip codes for each
city in the list using the US Zip Code Database product
, purchased from ZIPWISE
7
, and then we obtain
the list of possible names and abbreviations for each
city from the USPS.
· Ambiguity: When we deal with city names, we have
to deal with the ambiguity of the city name reference.
First, we can not guarantee whether the possible city
name reference actually refers to the city name. For
instance, New York might refer to New York as city
name or New York as part of the brand name "New
York Fries" or New York as state name. Second, a
city name can refer to cities in different states. For
example, four states, New York, Georgia, Oregon and
4
http://www.dmoz.org
5
http://www.hostip.info
6
http://www.usps.gov
7
http://www.zipwise.com
California, have a city called Albany. For both cases,
unless we fully analyze the context in which the reference
was made, the city name reference might be
inherently ambiguous. Note that for the full content
based collaboration, the issue of ambiguity is already
handled through the term pr(s
i
|c
i
) of the Eq. 2. For
the extended anchor text based and the URL based
collaborations, we always treat the possible city name
reference as the city that has the largest population
size. For instance, Glendale found in either the URL
address of page or the extended anchor text of page
would be treated as the city name reference for Glendale
, AZ.

<SECTION header="EVALUATION MODELS">To assess the performance of each crawling collaboration
strategy, it is imperative to determine how much geographically
-aware pages were downloaded for each strategy and
whether the downloaded pages are actually pertinent to the
targeted geographic locations. Note that while some previous
works [2, 15, 18, 5] attempt to define precisely what a
geographically-aware page is, determining whether a page is
geographically-aware or not remains as an open problem [2,
18]. For our particular application, we define the notion of
geographical awareness of page through geographic entities
[21]. We refer the address description of a physical organization
or a person as geographic entity. Since the targeted
geographical city-state pairs for our experiments are the top
100 US cities, a geographic entity in the context of our experiments
are further simplified as an address information,
following the standard US address format, for any of the
top 100 US cities. In other words, a geographic entity in
our context is a sequence of Street Number, Street Name,
City Name and State Name, found as part of the content
of page. Next, we present various evaluation measures for
our crawling strategies based on geographic entities. Ad-ditionally
, we present traditional measures to quantify the
performance of any collaborative crawling. Note that our
evaluation measures are later used in our experiments.
· Geo-coverage: When a page contain at least one geographic
entity (i.e. address information), then the
page is clearly a geographically aware page. Therefore
, we define the geo-coverage of retrieved pages as
the number of retrieved pages with at least one geographic
entity, pertinent to the targeted geographical
locations (e.g., the top US 100 cities) over the total
number of retrieved pages.
· Geo-focus: Each crawling node of the geographically
focused collaborative crawler is responsible for a subset
of the targeted geographic locations. For instance,
suppose we have two geographically sensitive crawling
nodes Cn
1
, and Cn
2
, and the targeted city-state
pairs as {(New York, NY),(Los Angeles, CA)}. Suppose
Cn
1
is responsible for crawling pages pertinent to
(New York, NY) while Cn
2
is responsible for crawling
8
Note that this simple approach does minimally hurt the
overall crawling. For instance, in many cases, even the incorrect
assessment of the state name reference New York
instead of the correct city name reference New York, would
result into the assignment of all extracted URLs to the correct
crawling node.

Figure 2: An example of geo-centrality measure
pages pertinent to (Los Angeles, CA). Therefore, if the
Cn
1
has downloaded a page about Los Angeles, CA,
then this would be clearly a failure of the collaborative
crawling approach.
To formalize this notion, we define the geo-focus of a
crawling node, as the number of retrieved pages that
contain at least one geographic entity of the assigned
city-state pairs of the crawling node.
· Geo-centrality: One of the most frequently and fundamental
measures used for the analysis of network
structures is the centrality measure which address the
question of how central a node is respect to other nodes
in the network. The most commonly used ones are the
degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality
and betweenness centrality [3]. Motivated by
the closeness centrality and the betweenness centrality
, Lee et al. [21] define novel centrality measures
to assess how a node is central with respect to those
geographically-aware nodes (pages with geographic entities
). A geodesic path is the shortest path, in terms
of the number of edges transversed, between a specified
pair of nodes. Geo-centrality measures are based
on the geodesic paths from an arbitrary node to a geographically
aware node.
Given two arbitrary nodes, p
i
, p
j
, let GD(p
i
, p
j
) be
the geodesic path based distance between p
i
and p
j
(the length of the geodesic path). Let w

i
,p
j
)
=
1/m
GD
(p

)
for some m
and we define (p

otherwise
For any node p

, let
k
(p

) = {p

|GD(p

the set nodes of whose geodesic distance from p

is less
than k.

Intuitively the geo-centrality measure computes how
many links have to be followed by a user which starts
his navigation from page p
i
to reach geographically-aware
pages. Moreover, w
GD
(p
i
,p
j
)
is used to penalize
each following of link by the user.
Example 3. Let consider the graph structure of Figure
2. Suppose that the weights are given as w
0
=
1, w
1
= 0.1, w
2
= 0.01, i.e. each time a user navigates
a link, we penalize it with 0.1. Given the root node 1
containing at least one geo-entity, we have
2
(node 1)=
{1, . . . , 8}. Therefore, we have w

= 0.01,
w
GD

= 0.01. Finally, GCt
k
(node 1) =
1.34.
· Overlap: The Overlap measure is first introduced in
[10]. In the collaborative crawling, it is possible that
different crawling nodes download the same page multiple
times. Multiple downloads of the same page are
clearly undesirable. Therefore, the overlap of retrieved
pages is defined as
N -I
N
where N denotes the total
number of downloaded pages by the overall crawler
and I denotes the number of unique downloaded pages
by the overall crawler. Note that the hash based collaboration
approach does not have any overlap.
· Diversity: In a crawling, it is possible that the crawling
is biased toward a certain domain name. For instance
, a crawler might find a crawler trap which is
an infinite loop within the web that dynamically produces
new pages trapping the crawler within this loop
[6]. To formalize this notion, we define the diversity
as
S
N
where S denotes the number of unique domain
names of downloaded pages by the overall crawler and
N denotes the total number of downloaded pages by
the overall crawler.
· Communication overhead: In a collaborative crawling
, the participating crawling nodes need to exchange
URLs to coordinate the overall crawling work.
To
quantify how much communication is required for this
exchange, the communication overhead is defined in
terms of the exchanged URLs per downloaded page
[10].

Experiment Description
We built an geographically focused collaborative crawler
that consists of one general crawling node, Cn
0
and five
geographically sensitive crawling nodes, {Cn

}, as
described in Section 3.4. The targeted city-state pairs were
the top 100 US cities by the population size, whose list was
obtained from the city-data.com

.
We partition the targeted city-state pairs according to
their time zone to assign these to the geographically sensitive
crawling nodes as shown in Table 1. In other words, we
have the following architecture design as illustrated in Figure

is general crawler targeting pages which are not
geographically-aware. Cn

We developed our collaborative crawler by extending the
open source crawler, larbin

written in C++. Each crawling
node was to dig each domain name up to the five levels
of depth. The crawling nodes were deployed over 2 servers,
each of them with 3.2 GHz dual P4 processors, 1 GB of
RAM, and 600 GB of disk space. We ran our crawler for the
period of approximately 2 weeks to download approximately
12.8 million pages for each crawling strategy as shown in
Table 2. For each crawling process, the usable bandwidth
was limited to 3.2 mbps, so the total maximum bandwidth
used by our crawler was 19.2 mbps. For each crawling, we
used the category "Top: Regional: North America: United
States" of the ODP as the seed page of crawling. The IP
mapping tool used in our experiments did not return the

Discussion
5.2.1
Quality Issue
As the first step toward the performance evaluation of our
crawling strategies, we built an extractor for the extraction
of geographic entities (addresses) from downloaded pages.
Our extractor, being a gazetteer based, extracted those geographic
entities using a dictionary of all possible city name
references for the top 100 US cities augmented by a list of all
possible street abbreviations (e.g., street, avenue, av., blvd)
and other pattern matching heuristics. Each extracted geographic
entity candidate was further matched against the
database of possible street names for each city that we built
from the 2004 TIGER/Line files
11
. Our extractor was shown
to yield 96% of accuracy out of 500 randomly chosen geographic
entities.
We first analyze the geo-coverage of each crawling strategy
as shown in Table 3. The top performers for the geo-coverage
are the URL based and extended anchor text based
collaborative strategies whose portion of pages downloaded
with geographic entities was 7.25% and 7.88%, respectively,
strongly suggesting that URL address of page and extended
anchor text of link are important features to be considered
for the discovery of geographically-aware pages. The next
best performer with respect to geo-coverage was the full content
based collaborative strategy achieving geo-coverage of
4.89%. Finally, the worst performers in the group of geographically
focused collaborative policies were the classification
based and the IP-address based strategies. The poor
performance of the IP-address based collaborative policy
shows that the actual physical location of web service is not
necessarily associated with the geographical scopes of pages
served by web service. The extremely poor performance of
the classification based crawler is surprising since this kind
of collaboration strategy shows to achieve good performance
for the topic-oriented crawling [12]. Finally, the worst performance
is observed with the URL-hash based collaborative
policy as expected whose portion of pages with geographical
entities out of all retrieved pages was less than 1%. In
conclusion, the usage of even simple but intuitively sounding
geographically focused collaborative policies can improve
the performance of standard collaborative crawling by a factor
of 3 to 8 for the task of collecting geographically-aware
pages.
To check whether each geographically sensitive crawling
node is actually downloading pages corresponding to their
assigned city-state pairs, we used the geo-focus as shown in

Table 5: Number of unique geographic entities over
the total number of geographic entities
Table 4. Once again, the URL-based and the extended anchor
text based strategies show to perform well with respect
to this particular measure achieving in average above 85%
of geo-focus. Once again, their relatively high performance
strongly suggest that the city name reference within a URL
address of page or an extended anchor text is a good feature
to be considered for the determination of geographical
scope of page. The geo-focus value of 75.2% for the content
based collaborative strategy also suggests that the locality
phenomena which occurs with the topic of page also occurs
within the geographical dimension as well. It is reported,
[13], that pages tend to reference (point to) other pages on
the same general topic. The relatively high geo-focus value
for the content based collaborative strategy indicates that
pages on the similar geographical scope tend to reference
each other. The IP-address based policy achieves 51.7% of
geo-focus while the classification based policy only achieves
22.7% of geo-focus. The extremely poor geo-focus of the
classification based policy seems to be due to the failure of
the classifier for the determination of the correct geographical
scope of page.
In the geographically focused crawling, it is possible that
pages are biased toward a certain geographic locations. For
instance, when we download pages on Las Vegas, NV, it is
possible that we have downloaded a large number of pages
which are focused on a few number of casino hotels in Las
Vegas, NV which are highly referenced to each other. In
this case, quality of the downloaded pages would not be that
good since most of pages would contain a large number of
very similar geographic entities. To formalize the notion, we
depict the ratio between the number of unique geographic
entities and the total number of geographic entities from
the retrieved pages as shown in Table 5. This ratio verifies
whether each crawling policy is covering sufficient number of
pages whose geographical scope is different. It is interesting

Table 7: Overlap of crawling strategies
to note that those geographically focused collaborative policies
, which show to have good performance relative to the
previous measures, such as the URL based, the extended anchor
text based and the full content based strategies tend to
discover pages with less diverse geographical scope. On the
other hand, the less performed crawling strategies such as
the IP-based, the classification based, the URL-hash based
strategies are shown to collect pages with more diverse geographical
scope.
We finally study each crawling strategy in terms of the
geo-centrality measure as shown in Table 6. One may observe
from Table 6 that the geo-centrality value provides an
accurate view on the quality of the downloaded geo graphically-aware
pages for each crawling strategy since the geo-centrality
value for each crawling strategy follows what we have obtained
with respect to geo-coverage and geo-precision. URL
based and extended anchor text based strategies show to
have the best geo-centrality values with 0.1754 and 0.1519
respectively, followed by the full content based strategy with
0.0994, followed by the IP based strategy with 0.0380, and
finally the hash based strategy and the classification based
strategy show to have similarly low geo-centrality values.
5.2.2
Performance Issue
In Table 7, we first show the overlap measure which reflects
the number of duplicated pages out of the downloaded
pages. Note that the hash based policy does not have any
duplicated page since its page assignment is completely independent
of other page assignment. For the same reason,
the overlap for the URL based and the IP based strategies
are none. The overlap of the extended anchor text

Table 8: Diversity of crawling strategies
based is 0.08461 indicating that the extended anchor text of
page computes the geographically scope of the corresponding
URL in an almost unique manner.
In other words,
there is low probability that two completely different city
name references are found within a URL address. Therefore
, this would be another reason why the extended anchor
text would be a good feature to be used for the partition of
the web within the geographical context. The overlap of the
full content based and the classification based strategies are
relatively high with 0.173239 and 0.34599 respectively.
In Table 8, we present the diversity of the downloaded
pages. The diversity values of geographically focused collaborative
crawling strategies suggest that most of the geographically
focused collaborative crawling strategies tend to
favor those pages which are found grouped under the same
domain names because of their crawling method. Especially,
the relatively low diversity value of the URL based strongly
emphasizes this tendency. Certainly, this matches with the
intuition since a page like "http://www.houston-guide.com"
will eventually lead toward the download of its child page
"http://www.houston-guide.com/guide/arts/framearts.html"
which shares the same domain.
In Table 9, we present the communication-overhead of
each crawling strategy.
Cho and Garcia-Molina [10] report
that the communication overhead of the Hash-Based
with two processors is well above five. The communication-overhead
of the Hash-based policy that we have follows with
what they have obtained.
The communication overhead
of geographically focused collaborative policies is relatively
high due to the intensive exchange of URLs between crawling
nodes.
In Table 10, we summarize the relative merits of the proposed
geographically focused collaborative crawling strategies
. In the Table, "Good" means that the strategy is expected
to perform relatively well for the measure, "Not Bad"
means that the strategy is expected to perform relatively acceptable
for that particular measure, and "Bad" means that
it may perform worse compared to most of other collaboration
strategies.
5.3
Geographic Locality
Many of the potential benefits of topic-oriented collaborative
crawling derive from the assumption of topic locality,
that pages tend to reference pages on the same topic [12,
13]. For instance, a classifier is used to determine whether
the child page is in the same topic as the parent page and
then guide the overall crawling [12]. Similarly, for geographically
focused collaborative crawling strategies we make the
assumption of geographic locality, that pages tend to reference
pages on the same geographic location. Therefore,
the performance of a geographically focused collaborative
crawling strategy is highly dependent on its way of exploiting
the geographic locality. That is whether the correspond-Type

Table 9: Communication-overhead
ing strategy is based on the adequate features to determine
the geographical similarity of two pages which are possibly
linked. We empirically study in what extent the idea of geographic
locality holds. Recall that given the list of city-state
pairs G = {~
c
1
, . . . , ~
c
k
} and a geographically focused crawling
collaboration strategy (e.g., URL based collaboration),
pr(~
c
i
|p
j
) is the probability that page is p
j
is pertinent to
city-state pair c
i
according to that particular strategy. Let
gs(p, q), geographic similarity between pages p, q, be
gs(p, q) =

In other words, our geographical similarity determines
whether two pages are pertinent to the same city-state pair.
Given , the set of retrieved page for the considered crawling
strategy, let () and ~
() be
() = |{(p
i
, p
j
)   × |p

, p
j

|{(p

, p
j
not linked and gs(p, q) = 1}|
|{(p
i
, p
j
)   × |p
i
, p
j
not linked}|
Note that () corresponds to the probability that a pair
of linked pages, chosen uniformly at random, is pertinent to
the same city-state pair under the considered collaboration
strategy while ~
() corresponds to the probability that a
pair of unlinked pages, chosen uniformly at random, is pertinent
to the same city-state pair under the considered collaboration
strategy. Therefore, if the geographic locality occurs
then we would expect to have high () value compared to
that of ~
(). We selected the URL based, the classification
based, and the full content based collaboration strategies,
and calculated both () and ~
() for each collaboration
strategy. In Table 11, we show the results of our computation
. One may observe from Table 11 that those pages that
share the same city-state pair in their URL address have the
high likelihood of being linked. Those pages that share the
same city-state pair in their content have some likelihood
of being linked. Finally, those pages which are classified as
sharing the same city-state pair are less likely to be linked.
We may conclude the following:
· The geographical similarity of two web pages affects
the likelihood of being referenced. In other words, geographic
locality, that pages tend to reference pages
on the same geographic location, clearly occurs on the
web.
· A geographically focused collaboration crawling strategy
which properly explores the adequate features for
determining the likelihood of two pages being in the
same geographical scope would expect to perform well
for the geographically focused crawling.

<SECTION header="CONCLUSION">In this paper, we studied the problem of geographically
focused collaborative crawling by proposing several collaborative
crawling strategies for this particular type of crawling.
We also proposed various evaluation criteria to measure the
relative merits of each crawling strategy while empirically
studying the proposed crawling strategies with the download
of real web data. We conclude that the URL based and
the extended anchor text based crawling strategies have the
best overall performance. Finally, we empirically showed
geographic locality, that pages tend to reference pages on
the same geographical scope. For the future research, it
would be interesting to incorporate more sophisticated features
(e.g., based on DOM structures) to the proposed crawling
strategies.
