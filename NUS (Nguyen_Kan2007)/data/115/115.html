<DIV style="position:absolute;top:732;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">In December 2001 a meeting (CITC-1) of interested parties from <br>fifteen four-year IT programs from the US along with <br>representatives from IEEE, ACM, and ABET began work on the <br>formalization of Information Technology as an accredited <br>academic discipline. The effort has evolved into SIGITE, the <br>ACM SIG for Information Technology Education. During  this <br>evolution three main efforts have proceeded in parallel: 1) <br>Definition of accreditation standards for IT programs, 2) Creation <br>of a model curriculum for four-year IT programs, and 3) <br>Description of the characteristics that distinguish IT programs <br>from the sister disciplines in computing.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:914;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">One of the biggest challenges during the creation of the model <br>curriculum was understanding and presenting the knowledge area </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">that was originally called "security".  Some of us were <br>uncomfortable with the term because it was not broad enough to <br>cover the range of concepts that we felt needed to be covered.  We <br>became aware of a community that had resolved many of the <br>issues associated with the broader context we were seeking, <br>Information Assurance.  Information assurance has been defined <br>as "a set of measures intended to protect and defend information <br>and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, <br>authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. This includes <br>providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating <br>protection, detection, and reaction capabilities."  The IA <br>community and work done by IA educators became useful in <br>defining requisite security knowledge for information technology <br>education programs.  </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:566;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">We believe that the Information Technology and the Information <br>Assurance Education communities have much to share. At the 9</span></nobr></DIV>

In the current paper we introduce the history and <br>current state of IA education to the SIGITE community.  In <br>addition, we demonstrate how significant concepts from the <br>Information Assurance community have been integrated into <br>IT2005. </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:741;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">In the first week of December of 2001 representatives from 15 <br>undergraduate information technology (IT) programs from across <br>the country gathered together near Provo, Utah, to develop a <br>community and begin to establish academic standards for this <br>rapidly growing discipline.  This first Conference on Information <br>Technology Curriculum (CITC-1) was also attended by <br>representatives from two professional societies, the Association <br>for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical <br>and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), and also the Accreditation <br>Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET). This <br>invitational conference was the culmination of an effort begun <br>several months earlier by five of these universities who had <br>formed a steering committee to organize a response from existing <br>IT programs to several initiatives to define the academic discipline <br>of IT. The steering committee wanted to ensure that the input of <br>existing programs played a significant role in the definition of the <br>field. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1020;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">A formal society and three main committees were formed by the <br>attendees of CITC-1. The society was the Society for Information <br>Technology Education (SITE); one of the committees formed was </span></nobr></DIV>

The other two committees formed were the <br>IT Curriculum Committee, including subcommittees for 4-year <br>and 2-year programs, and the IT Accreditation Committee, also <br>including subcommittees for 4-year and 2-year programs. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:213;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">The development of IT as an academic discipline is similar to the <br>process that computer science (CS) went through in the 70's and <br>80's. In fact, looking at the placement of CS programs in academic <br>institutions around the U.S. illustrates the debate that swirled <br>around the discipline as its core was being defined. Some CS <br>programs are in departments of mathematics, others are in <br>engineering schools, and many others have become mainstay <br>programs within newly emerging colleges of computing. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:348;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">Information technology, as it is practiced at this moment in its <br>evolution, reflects similar growing pains. IT programs exist in <br>colleges of computing, in CS departments, in schools of <br>technology, and in business schools. Professors of information <br>technology possess degrees in information systems, electronics, <br>communications, graphics arts, economics, mathematics, <br>computer science, and other disciplines. Few to none of them <br>have a degree in information technology. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:484;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">It should be acknowledged here that IT has two substantially <br>different interpretations, and that these should be clarified. <br>Information Technology (IT) in its broadest sense encompasses all <br>aspects of computing technology. IT, as an academic discipline, <br>focuses on meeting the needs of users within an organizational <br>and societal context through the selection, creation, application, <br>integration and administration of computing technologies.

(National Security Agency, <br>http://www.nsa.gov/ia/iaFAQ.cfm?MenuID=10#1).[5]   <br>Information assurance education, then, includes all efforts to <br>prepare a workforce with the needed knowledge, skills, and <br>abilities to assure our information systems, especially critical <br>national security systems.  Information assurance education has <br>been growing in importance and activity for the past two decades.  <br>A brief look at the involved entities and history will shed light on <br>the growth.   </span></nobr></DIV>

The NIETP was <br>initiated in 1990 under National Security Directive 42 and has <br>since been reauthorized several times.  The NIETP serves in the <br>capacity of national manager for information assurance education <br>and training related to national security systems and coordinates <br>this effort with the Committee on National Security Systems <br>(CNSS).  "The CNSS provides a forum for the discussion of <br>policy issues, sets national policy, and promulgates direction, <br>operational procedures, and guidance for the security of national <br>security systems.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">Training Standard for Information Security Risk Analysts will be <br>released soon.   <br>The NSTISSI-CNSSI standards referenced above have been used <br>to develop in-service training and education opportunities for <br>enlisted and civilian employees in an effort to assure quality <br>preparation of professionals entrusted with securing our critical <br>information.  In addition to providing a basis for in-service <br>education and training, the NSTISSI-CNSSI standards have also <br>been deployed to colleges and universities in an effort to also <br>prepare qualified individuals preservice.  The most significant <br>effort to involve colleges and universities has been through the <br>National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information <br>Assurance Education (CAEIAE) Program.  The CAEIAE program <br>was started in 1998 by the National Security Agency (NSA) and is <br>now jointly sponsored by the NSA and the Department of <br>Homeland Security (DHS) in support of the President's National <br>Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, February 2003. The purpose of the <br>program is to recognize colleges and universities for their efforts <br>in information assurance education and also to encourage more <br>colleges and universities to develop courses and programs of <br>study in information assurance.   In order to be eligible to apply <br>for CAEIAE certification, an institution must first demonstrate <br>that it teaches the content covered in NSTISSI 4011 - The <br>National Training Standard for Information Systems Security <br>Professionals.  Once an institution has been 4011 certified, it is <br>eligible to apply for CAEIAE status.  Criteria for becoming a <br>CAEIAE include the following:  a) evidence of partnerships in IA <br>education, b) IA must be treated as a multidisciplinary science, c) <br>evidence that the university encourages the practice of <br>information assurance in its operations, d) demonstration of <br>information assurance research, e) demonstration that the IA <br>curriculum reaches beyond physical geographic borders, f) <br>evidence of faculty productivity in information assurance research <br>and scholarship, g) demonstration of state of the art information <br>assurance resources, h) a declared concentration(s) in information <br>assurance, i) a university recognized center in information <br>assurance, and j) dedicated information assurance faculty <br>(http://www.nsa.gov/ia/academia/caeCriteria.cfm?MenuID=10.1.1<br>.2).[7]   </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">In 1999, there were seven institutions designated as the inaugural <br>CAEIAE schools.  The certification is good for three years at <br>which time institutions can reapply.  Annually, an additional 6-10 <br>institutions are awarded the certification; today, there are more <br>than 60 CAEIAE institutions.  The types of institutions and <br>programs that are applying and being certified are growing not <br>just in number, but also in diversity.  In the first round of <br>certification, the institutions were largely research institutions and <br>their respective programs were at the graduate level in computer <br>science.  Today, institutions are certifying courses at the <br>undergraduate level in computer science, management <br>information systems, and information technology.  The work <br>being done by SIGITE is important to the further expansion of <br>information assurance education as information assurance <br>expands beyond the development of information systems to <br>include the entire system life cycle including deployment, <br>operation, maintenance, a retirement of such systems.   </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:638;left:535"><nobr><span class="ft3">Area (KA)  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:717;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">IAS is the only area that is an IT Fundamental, a "pervasive <br>theme" and also a complete KA with a recommended senior level <br>course for integrating all of the concepts.  Clearly, IT2005 <br>presents Information Assurance and Security as a core <br>competency required by every graduate of an IT program. <br>During the early analysis of IT as an academic discipline, Delphi <br>studies were performed that ranked "Security" as a central area for <br>IT.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:848;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">committees involved were uncomfortable with "security" as the <br>name for the knowledge area.  The name seemed too restrictive.  <br>At the annual SIGITE conference in 2003 two of the authors were <br>introduced to the other author and the Center for Research and <br>Education in Information Assurance and Security (Cerias) at <br>Purdue.  The BYU faculty was dissatisfied with the security <br>component in the IT curriculum and the SIGITE curriculum <br>committee was struggling with the Security KA for IT2005.   <br>Through flyers at the conference we became aware of the <br>Information Assurance Education Graduate Certificate (IAEGC) <br>program funded by the NSA.  With encouragement from <br>colleagues and the administration of the School of Technology, <br>the primary author attended the 2004 program.  The experience <br>has had a significant impact on IT2005 and the BYU curriculum. </span></nobr></DIV>

The themes touch many of the topics <br>throughout the curriculum.  Every time a new technology is <br>announced in the media, an instructor has the opportunity to drive <br>home the importance of "life-long learning".  Every time there is a <br>cyber-crime in the media we have the opportunity to discuss the <br>ethical and professional ramifications.   It is recommended that an <br>IT Fundamentals course be taught early in the curriculum where <br>all of these themes are introduced and discussed as concepts that <br>touch everything an IT professional does. <br>Each of these topics deserves a full treatment; however, for the <br>purposes of this paper we will focus on IAS, possibly the most <br>pervasive theme. We will address one approach to achieve <br>addressing IAS "multiple times in multiple classes" in section 6 <br>below. <br> </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:628;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft15">4.  THE INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND <br>SECURITY  KNOWLEDGE AREA </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:670;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">In early 2003, the SIGITE curriculum committee divided into <br>working groups around the knowledge areas defined by [3] to <br>make an initial cut at the list of topics for each KA.  A significant <br>revision was accomplished and reviewed by the participants at the <br>2004 IAEGC program at Purdue in August 2004. The list of areas <br>for the IAS KA was finalized in late 2004 at a full IT Curriculum <br>Committee meeting.  The draft of the completed IAS KA  was <br>completed in early Feb 2005 by the IAS working group, edited by <br>the writing committee in late Feb 2005  and was  presented to the <br>full committee in April 2005.   <br>Figure 3 is a list of the IAS KA and its areas.  The basic structure <br>and vocabulary is derived directly from work done in the IA <br>community, specifically Maconachy, et. al.[11].  The number in <br>parenthesis is the number of lecture hours the committee thought <br>would be required to give an IT student minimum exposure to the <br>unit.  It should be noted that the ordering of units in all of the <br>KAs, is first "Fundamentals", if there is one, and then the units are <br>sorted in order of the number of core hours.  This ordering should <br>not be considered as any indication of the order the units would <br>be covered pedagogically in an implemented curriculum.  </span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:620;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft1">5.  IT AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:641;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">The Information Technology program at BYU began officially in <br>Fall 2001 with a faculty consisting of: <br>1. Two electronics engineering technology (EET) professors who <br>were instrumental in the evolution of the existing EET program at <br>BYU into an IT program,  <br>2. One electrical engineering, Ph.D. newly arrived from the <br>aerospace industry. <br>3. One computer science instructor who had done part time <br>teaching and had been part of the department for 1 year with <br>several years in system development in health care. <br>4. One computer science Ph.D. with recent executive management <br>responsibilities in network hardware and service provider <br>businesses. <br>5. The former department chair of the technology education <br>program for secondary schools joined in 2002.  <br>6. One computer science Ph. D. with extensive industry <br>experience in data privacy and IT management joined in 2004. <br>This is obviously a diverse group of people, each of whom joined <br>the department because they thought that the existing computing <br>programs at BYU did not offer students preparation for the <br>practical aspects of system delivery to customers.  We are evenly <br>divided between long-term academics and recent `retreads' from <br>industry.   However, the academics have also each had significant <br>industrial experience, which provided the motivation for them to <br>accept positions in the new IT program. The BYU curriculum </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">began as a traditional "stovepipe" approach of courses oriented <br>around topics like networking, databases, and operating systems <br>borrowed from CS, EET, CE and IS, and evolved to a more <br>integrated approach starting at the introductory levels so that <br>advanced topic oriented courses are more easily sequenced.  We <br>have also discovered that the integrative nature of IT forces a <br>focus on the seams between technologies rather than <br>implementation of components. This fundamental difference in <br>focus is one of the primary differences that distinguishes IT from <br>other computing disciplines that focus on the design and <br>implementation of components[12] [13].  Over the last 4 years, <br>BYU faculty has participated actively in SIGITE and attempted to <br>share what has been learned with the emerging IT community. <br>[14] [15] [16] <br>The BYU curriculum has evolved into what IT2005 calls a <br>"core/integration first" approach [17].   Significant portions of the <br>introductory material in operating systems, databases, web <br>systems, networking had been moved to lower division courses by <br>early 2004.  Much of the shift occurred when the introduction to <br>web systems was moved from the junior to the sophomore year <br>and introductory material sufficient to understand web systems <br>was included for networking, databases, operating system <br>administration and OS process models. The improvements in flow <br>and reduced redundancy have been noticeable in the upper <br>division core courses. Appendix B graphs the current BYU course <br>structure.   In late 2004 and early 2005 we began implementing <br>the "pervasive theme" of IAS in earnest. </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:552;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft15">6.  INTEGRATING IAS INTO THE <br>EXISTING BYU CURRICULUM </span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:594;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft8">A senior level IAS class had been introduced into the curriculum <br>in early 2004 and was made a requirement in 2005.  However, we <br>recognized that simply adding a required course at the end of a <br>student's college experience would not be adequate.  SIGITE <br>discussions had placed security in the pervasive theme category at <br>the very beginning, though the name of the KA wasn't chosen <br>until 2004.  We were faced with the challenge of integrating the <br>IAS fundamentals into the introductory courses, morphing the <br>security modules in the existing classes to use the MSRW [11] <br>framework and bringing all of the students in the program up to <br>speed on the new framework simultaneously. <br>Our approach has been to prepare one hour modules on the <br>MSRW framework that can be used in an existing course to bring <br>students up to speed or taught in seminars as needed.  We are in <br>the process of integrating the IAS Fundamentals into our <br>introductory courses.  We successfully integrated the IAS modules <br>into the sophomore introduction to web-based systems course, <br>which was already introducing all of the major IT areas.  The <br>course was modified to replace a 3 week team project experience <br>with a 2 week team oriented lab and then using the time for IAS <br>topics.  Much remains to be done, but the initial experience is <br>positive.  The faculty seems unified in their desire to implement <br>IAS as a pervasive theme.   For example, 2 lecture and 2 lab hours <br>are now included in the computer communications course.  3 <br>lecture hours and 3 lab hours were added to the web systems <br>course.  The IAS component of the database course was <br>rearranged and strengthened with 1 lecture hour added.  Similar <br>adjustments have been made throughout the curriculum. </span></nobr></DIV>
