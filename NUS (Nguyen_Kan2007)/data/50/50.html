<DIV style="position:absolute;top:769;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">New technologies make it feasible and in many cases practical for<br>individuals, groups, and organizations to collaborate in the<br>development of joint information systems. In fact, over the last<br>three decades of evolution, few applications of information<br>technology have stimulated so much interest on the part of so<br>many. Collaborative information systems are attractive to users<br>because they make it possible to find information from diverse<br>sources in an easy and efficient way. Such systems make good<br>sense for information providers because it becomes possible to</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:352;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">attract a larger audience than a solitary effort might otherwise be<br>able to command and to pool resources to achieve certain<br>economies in scale and technology expense.  The advantages of<br>collaborative computerized information systems have been widely<br>recognized, but this has been particularly the case for those with<br>the goal of making community information more available,<br>accessible, and oriented toward community development.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:472;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Computerized community information systems are diverse in form<br>and, over time, have come to be known by many different names,<br>including community bulletin boards, civic networks, community<br>networks, community information networks, televillages, smart<br>communities, and Free-Nets. They have been initiated by many<br>different sponsors, including government organizations at the<br>federal, state, and local levels, academic organizations, libraries,<br>and ad hoc groups of citizens that may or may not later transform<br>their enterprises into not-for-profit organizations [7]. With respect<br>to longevity, these projects have come and gone, only to be<br>replaced by newer and more sophisticated manifestations of the<br>same basic information sharing capabilities.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:671;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Consistent with the evolution of technology over the last thirty<br>years, Kubicek and Wagner [14] analyze the historical trajectory<br>of community networks to understand how these applications<br>have evolved over time based upon their animating ideas, the<br>zeitgeist of the time, the state of technology access, and the kinds<br>of services such applications make available.   Their analysis<br>makes it possible to see that there has never been a standard for<br>design or operation when it comes to community information<br>systems.  Instead, each such project has been very much a social<br>experiment, born of a cluster of varied ideas related to the general<br>theme of using technology to promote the development of vibrant<br>geographically-based communities.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:870;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Since there has been no standard to follow, each instance of<br>computerized community information system can be seen as an<br>experiment in accommodating the tensions between access to<br>hardware/software infrastructure, design of the particular<br>application or system, user needs, and the initiating and ongoing<br>resources that support these efforts.  These projects can be<br>resource intensive; thus, a variety of institutional actors have lent<br>their financial support particularly over the past decade.  The<br>successive rounds of funding for community technology projects<br>by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications<br>and Information Administration (now called the Technology<br>Opportunities Program) is a case in point.  The Digital<br>Government Program of the National Science Foundation has</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">provided support for such ventures, as have many private<br>foundations and technology corporations.   From the perspective<br>of funding organizations, the nature of the experiment at the heart<br>of CCINs is essentially this:  how to build applications that<br>achieve their civic goals, that provide services perceived as<br>valuable by their users, and that can command continuing support<br>from the community beyond the horizon of initial funding.   From<br>a purely academic perspective, the more general question centers<br>on, as Venkatesh [28] has put it, the "lifecycle" of community<br>information systems.  More specifically, we wish to know how<br>such systems "originate, stabilize, and change in their<br>sociohistorical context" (p. 339).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:308;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">We do not have extensive knowledge about the extent to which<br>community information systems achieve their goals, endure over<br>time, or the conditions that facilitate effectiveness and<br>sustainability.  However, based on what we do know, it is<br>apparent that such enterprises are fragile.  Perhaps the closest we<br>have come to a standard or model is the relatively extensive set of<br>experiments in community networking in the 1990s called Free-<br>Nets, which were fashioned after the public broadcasting system<br>and intended to serve their localities by providing access to wide-<br>area computer networks and information about the community.<br>Founded in 1989, the National Public Telecomputing Network, an<br>umbrella organization for Free-Nets, went bankrupt in 1996.<br>After successive decreases in the cost of computing equipment<br>and Internet access, and the development of the World Wide Web,<br>many Free-Nets went out of business [14].   Studies of community<br>networks funded by the federal and state governments also<br>suggest that community information systems have difficulty<br>enduring beyond their initial funding [26] [21].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:602;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">In this paper, we introduce and consider conditions that facilitate<br>the sustainability of computerized community information<br>systems.  We base our discussion in part on our own efforts to<br>develop a community information system called Connected Kids<br>in Troy, New York, a project that began in a formal sense in 1999<br>and continues today.  We begin by presenting a theoretical<br>framework for posing questions about sustainability based on the<br>social construction of technology and adaptive structuration<br>theory.  Drawing on the literature as well as our experiences, we<br>introduce and discuss three issues we believe to be critically<br>related to sustainability:  stakeholder involvement, commitment<br>from key players, and critical mass.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:810;left:95"><nobr><span class="ft7"><b> </b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:811;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:831;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">All computerized community information systems are designed,<br>although whether researchers and participants understand the<br>significance of design and its relevance to sustainability varies<br>from context to context.  In some cases, where community<br>networks have originated as the indigenous creation of<br>technology-savvy citizens, it may appear to researchers that the<br>design of the information system is a natural expression of<br>community development unfettered by theoretical considerations.<br>However, in other cases, design is taken more seriously and<br>treated as an element that can be purposefully controlled in order<br>to achieve particular kinds of effects.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1014;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">In either case, we argue that the material form, functionalities,<br>conceptual configuration, and impact of technology is shaped by<br>the uses, goals, interests, and ideologies of those who participate<br>in its development and others who use it following development.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">In the literature addressing the social construction of technology,<br>this argument is frequently illustrated by showing how users<br>appropriate new technologies for their own purposes, which may<br>be contrary to those of designers (see e.g. [15] [25]). However, we<br>take this position one step further by suggesting that community<br>information systems, and information and communication<br>technologies more broadly, reflect the interests, orientations, and<br>indeed the naïve social theories of their designers, as well as being<br>shaped ex post facto by their users [8].  On this basis, we have<br>argued that academic researchers need to become involved in the<br>process of technology design as a way of exploring how to<br>improve the design of technology and as a way to test social<br>theory, including communication, information, and democratic<br>theory.  However, our position suggests that users of information<br>systems must also be included in their initial conceptualization<br>and design in order to develop systems that reflect users' needs,<br>goals, and values.  This leads quite naturally to creating<br>interdisciplinary (e.g. computer scientists, information scientists,<br>social scientists) application design teams that provide for<br>participation by community members; it is in such collaborative<br>arrangements that sustainable community information systems<br>may be designed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:466;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">The social construction of technology argues that technologies are<br>shaped by both designers and users and suggests that information<br>system design be undertaken collaboratively by those implicated<br>in both the technical and social conceptualization of the system.<br>However, issues of sustainability ultimately focus on reproduction<br>of the system.  Once designed, information systems must be<br>deployed, and once deployed, they must be re-enacted on a<br>routine basis by their users to be sustained. Adaptive structuration<br>theory is one of the most fully developed theoretical perspectives<br>for understanding how new technologies come to reproduce social<br>structures or to generate structural change in particular social<br>contexts. DeSanctis and Poole [4] base their work on structuration<br>processes originally described by Giddens [5].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:681;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Giddens [5] suggests that technologies in organizations either<br>reproduce existing social structure or change social structure by<br>virtue of the kinds of structures that are instantiated when social<br>actors use technologies.  Structure consists of rules and resources<br>that actors draw upon to produce social behavior. For DeSanctis<br>and Poole [4], social structures are physically incorporated in new<br>technologies in two complementary ways. First, technologies<br>embody rules and resources embedded in the form of particular<br>material capabilities, functionalities, and features that comprise a<br>variety of behavioral options to be used in constructing social<br>action.  Second, the "spirit" of a technology, also considered to be<br>a property of the technology, expresses the values and goals that<br>are brought to bear upon the tasks the technology was originally<br>intended to accomplish.  Together the features and spirit of a<br>technology comprise its "structural potential," or the range of<br>possible actions that users can draw upon to constitute or<br>reproduce social structures in technology use.  Orlikowski [17]<br>disputes a portion of this conceptualization, noting that, according<br>to Giddens [5], structure has a "virtual" rather than material<br>existence, and thus can never be physically incorporated into<br>technology.  Instead, &quot;[w]hile a technology may be seen to<br>embody particular symbol and material properties, it does not<br>embody structures because those are only instantiated in practice&quot;<br>([17], p. 206) and, if reproduced, are systematically repeated over<br>time.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Orlikowski's [17] point is that users may draw upon only some of<br>a technology's features, and may do that in ways that depart<br>substantially from the original conceptualizations of designers.  In<br>essence, users "enact" technology in their collective, systematic,<br>and routine use of a technology, reproducing some of the<br>technology and some of its associated  structures through practice.<br>Orlikowski's [17] term "technologies-in-practice" references the<br>idea that as users engage selectively with particular technological<br>features, particular structures, or sets of rules and resources<br>associated with the technology, are selectively reconstituted.<br>Thus, a technology-in-practice is a &quot;repeatedly experienced,<br>personally ordered and edited version of the technological artifact,<br>being experienced differently by different individuals and<br>differently by the same individuals depending on the time or<br>circumstances&quot; ([17], p. 408).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:355;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Applied to sustainability, our questions center on the conditions<br>under which users "appropriate" the system. For community<br>information systems, there are generally two kinds of users--<br>information providers and information consumers--and, of<br>course, the same individuals may play both user roles.  Thus, our<br>questions become:  Under what conditions do users collectively<br>and routinely draw upon and apply particular features of a<br>community information system? When do they reference the way<br>their system &quot;should&quot; work in order to construct a shared<br>perspective about community action? Through regular and routine<br>enactments of technology in regular use, users reproduce the rules<br>and resources or structures of community life that are instantiated<br>in technology use.  This is not to say that "unfaithful"<br>appropriations, or those that are out-of-line with the spirit of the<br>technology, cannot occur; but it is to say that it is unlikely they<br>will sustain a community information system.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:649;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft11"><b>SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY<br>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:690;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">We begin our discussion of factors related to sustainability by<br>distinguishing between the effectiveness and the sustainability of<br>computerized community information systems.  Community<br>information systems are designed and advocated with many goals<br>in mind, some of which focus on traditional issues of community<br>development, such as decreasing unemployment, stimulating<br>economic growth, improving health and social welfare, and others<br>focus on building social capital, or enhancing interest and<br>participation in government decision making processes.  The issue<br>of effectiveness addresses whether such systems are achieving the<br>goals for which they were designed.  Sustainability, on the other<br>hand, addresses whether the information system is able to endure<br>past its initial launching phase, whether it is used and reproduced<br>by its intended audience, and whether it can continue to attract<br>resources beyond those obtained for initial development and<br>deployment.  Clearly these two concepts are not irrelevant to each<br>other, but neither are they the same.  It is possible that questions<br>of sustainability logically precede those of effectiveness, but there<br>may also be important relationships between effectiveness and<br>sustainability.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1016;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Sustainability has long been a consideration in the development of<br>information systems.  Indeed, the failure rate of new IT<br>applications in the public sector has motivated significant interest<br>in addressing the issue of sustainability and speculation about the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">extent to which participation in system development is related<br>ultimately to system adoption and use [10] [11].  More<br>specifically, government services are increasingly out-sourced to<br>not-for-profit organizations that may not be experienced in<br>collaboration [3].  Information technology makes it possible for<br>organizations to collaborate in providing information but whether<br>or not such collaborations actually take place is more than a<br>technical issue.  The development of any information system, and<br>particularly collaborative systems, requires organizations to<br>change, in a very real way, some of their routine modes of<br>operation and incorporate new behaviors. Scholl's [22] research<br>finds that stakeholder involvement and the commitment of senior<br>executives to be highly related to the integration of e-government<br>projects into business process change for government<br>organizations.  Stakeholder involvement has long been<br>acknowledged as a key element in the construction of community<br>information system, although applied to this context rather than<br>that of traditional hierarchical organizations, the idea bears further<br>scrutiny.  We have also seen the commitment of key executives<br>playing a role in our own development work.  We discuss each of<br>these two ideas at some length below, and add a third:<br>development of a critical mass of users.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:476;left:510"><nobr><span class="ft3"><b>Stakeholder Involvement</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:496;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Our work was motivated in part by Schuler's [23] invitation to<br>academic researchers to collaborate with communities in building<br>community networking projects.  At the time, it was fair to<br>characterize our institution's hometown, Troy, NY, as a "digitally<br>divided" community. Our experiences suggested that new<br>technologies and their potential seemed to be of interest to the<br>members of the community (see [9]).  But many community and<br>government organizations lacked access to hardware and network<br>connections as well as the expertise needed for using this<br>equipment. It seemed most likely that we would need to do more<br>to generate interest in the development of a community<br>information service in order to stimulate participation from likely<br>stakeholders in such a project.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:711;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Connected Kids was conceived in Fall 1999 in the course of<br>discussions among Troy City Government representatives on the<br>topic of how new technologies might usefully be employed to<br>provide services to the community.  At the time we learned that<br>the mayor sought to reinvigorate the City's office of youth<br>services and had speculated about whether these technologies<br>could be used to provide one of that office's primary and most<br>popular functions, which was to disseminate information about<br>resources and programs sponsored by not-for-profit organizations<br>as well as those sponsored by Troy's own Department of<br>Recreation.  It seemed clear to us the World Wide Web might<br>indeed be used for such purposes.  Thus, Connected Kids was<br>conceived as both a digital government project as well as a<br>community information system.  We received initial assurances<br>that the City would administer the information system after it had<br>been successfully designed and deployed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:974;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Connected Kids began with sensitivity to the need for stakeholder<br>involvement, particularly that of participating organizations that<br>we hoped would be information providers.  We were aware that<br>the "best way to kill a community network," was to fail to involve<br>the community in system development [24].  We took seriously<br>Gygi's [6] prediction that the degree of community involvement</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">and the extent to which the project represented community<br>interests and participation would likely affect political and<br>economic outcomes.  Thus, although our project began initially as<br>a collaboration between academic researchers and government<br>administrators, we moved quickly to invite community<br>organizations to participate at an orientation meeting in February<br>2000 and held a series of focus group discussions in October 2000<br>in which we explored with representatives of participating<br>organizations how such an information system might be<br>conceptualized to best meet their information needs.  In Fall 2001<br>and Winter 2002 we undertook a series of participatory design<br>sessions in which representatives of participating organizations<br>were introduced to portions of a system prototype based on their<br>previous contributions and asked to describe their experiences and<br>suggest improvements.  Finally, as we designed interfaces in<br>Summer and Fall 2002, we again consulted with representatives of<br>participating organizations in user testing sessions.  By Fall 2003<br>and Winter 2004, we had demonstrated the system and trained<br>numerous representatives of participating organizations, who<br>reportedly found our interface pages easy to use.  However, these<br>same organizations were not spontaneously--or frequently--<br>entering information about their programs or activities for youth.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:466;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Based on contributions from our collaborating organizations, the<br>design of Connected Kids reflected much of the best wisdom<br>about community information systems:  the system could be used<br>to both create and easily update data [2] [13]; we had involved<br>end user groups (kids and their parents) in the design as well [27]<br>[12]; and the system focused principally on information deemed<br>crucial by our participating organizations, information that we<br>expected had the capacity to be integrated into the routine lives of<br>the communities they serve [21].  Further, access to technology<br>lost its urgency as an issue, since it is no longer the case that our<br>participating organizations lack access to networking technology.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:649;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Thus, we did not attribute our problems with data entry to system<br>attributes.  Instead, we considered the suggestion by Scott and<br>Page [18] that "sustainable technologies are processes (authors'<br>emphasis); they are not products."  In traditional hierarchical<br>organizations, lower levels of stakeholder involvement may be<br>sufficient for system acceptance.  However, a community<br>information system requires that members of the community<br>contribute information and it must be seen to be in their<br>continuing interest to do so.  In Fall 2004, we have sought to<br>create a quasi-formal governance body to administer the project, a<br>Connected Kids Advisory Board, recruiting representatives from<br>10 organizations (from among the most influential) to commit to<br>guiding the short-term future of the project (approximately 1 year)<br>as we transition to system deployment in Spring 2005.  Our Board<br>has now met for several months, and it remains to be seen whether<br>this vehicle will foster a sufficient level of system participation,<br>perhaps ownership, to sustain Connected Kids through<br>deployment and beyond.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:974;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Scholl [22] finds that support from key executives is critical to<br>incorporating e-government projects into an organization's<br>business processes, and our experience underscores this finding.<br>In fact, we would expand the range of individuals likely to be<br>considered "key."  Not only are senior executives important, but<br>so also are others in the organization that have any significant job-</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:109;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">related association with the information system under<br>development.  Application development projects take place over<br>potentially long periods of time and involve many different<br>individuals in many different roles.  Job occupants in the public<br>sector may be comparatively stable, but they are not permanent.<br>Those who champion an application development project may not<br>be around when it is time to deploy the system.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:228;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">What is generally not recognized when academic researchers<br>undertake technology projects in organizational contexts is that<br>they may need to become the primary advocates for deployment of<br>the project.  This is not a typical role for researchers, who may<br>with ample justification see their obligations confined to simply<br>performing the research or developmental work on the project.<br>However, researchers who seek to develop sustainable products<br>may find themselves required to situate the project politically<br>within the organization or group of organizations for which it was<br>originally intended.  They may in fact be the only individuals who<br>can play this particular role.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:412;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">In the case of Connected Kids, we secured commitment from both<br>the mayor and deputy mayor of Troy, along with, of course, that<br>of our primary organizational liaison.  We continued to work for<br>quite some time, reporting regularly on progress to our liaison,<br>without realizing that this individual was getting progressively<br>involved in turf battles with another technology-oriented actor in<br>city government.  As our liaison's influence within city<br>government eroded, so also did support for our project without<br>our awareness.  Once we understood what was happening, we<br>acted quickly, and luckily in sufficient time, to re-establish the<br>importance of the project with the mayor and deputy mayor.<br>From that point hence our primary liaison was the deputy mayor.<br>Unfortunately, mayoral administrations come and go, and the<br>administration that was our primary government partner was<br>voted out of office in November 2003.  Within six months all the<br>individuals who had any primary working relationship with our<br>project were gone, and we faced the need to re-create commitment<br>with a new mayor and deputy mayor, a process that took<br>considerable time and that has delayed implementation by nearly a<br>year.  Of course, this is not something we could have prevented.<br>However, it is interesting to note that our new liaison with city<br>government is an individual who had worked in city government<br>under both administrations.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:815;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">Ultimately, for a community information system to endure, it must<br>establish a significant number of regular users, who enact the<br>technology for at least some of the purposes for which it was<br>originally intended, and in so doing, reproduce community<br>structures that are instantiated in the technology.  In our case, this<br>means bringing an audience of end users to the system who are<br>interested in information about youth that is disseminated through<br>it.  Connected Kids is in many respects similar to an electronic<br>"public good" [20], that is, a product established through the<br>contributions and for the benefit of a set of actors that also has the<br>effect of benefiting other users.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:998;left:477"><nobr><span class="ft9">In our case, the system was designed by and for youth<br>organizations, which serve as information providers. We have<br>sought to show how these organizations may appropriate the<br>technology and accomplish what Bannon and Griffin [1] suggest,<br>which is to use the technology as a means to  "further their own</span></nobr></DIV>

However, the added<br>value of a collaborative information system is that in bringing an<br>audience to information distributed by one organization, that<br>audience is also available to peruse the information of other<br>organizations.  Thus the overall effect is to increase the<br>cumulative size of the audience for all involved.  Further, the<br>external user audience benefits from the ease of accessing<br>information from a wide variety of organizations that all provide<br>services for youth.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:260;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Patterson and Kavanaugh [19] argue that the pro-social benefits of<br>a public good are achieved when the system achieves a critical<br>mass of users.  In our case, this would equal the number of users<br>that information providers consider to make it worth their<br>continuing efforts to input information about their activities.  As<br>Markus [16] points out, the number of users will depend on the<br>diversity and value of the information available through the<br>system.  Thus, sustainability is dependent on the reciprocal<br>interdependence of both information providers and information<br>users.  Both information in the system and use must achieve<br>critical mass, and this must happen relatively soon after<br>deployment.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:459;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Our strategy is to bring both of these activities together in time.<br>We have asked the Connected Kids Advisory Board to develop a<br>marketing campaign that will accompany the deployment of the<br>system and they are currently embarked on this activity.<br>Bolstered by the participation of RPI and the City of Troy, we<br>seek to attract a large external audience to experiment with the<br>system.  Advisory Board members recognize that the success of<br>the marketing campaign depends on the presence of considerable<br>amount of high quality information in the system, and have<br>committed to providing it.  In this way, we seek to jumpstart a<br>virtuous circle in which sufficient quantities of information and<br>use reciprocally reinforce each other creating a critical mass of<br>information providers and consumers.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:704;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft9">Poised for deployment, Connected Kids enables us to test a range<br>of expectations generated by this set of considerations regarding<br>sustainability.  Within the next year, we should be able to assess<br>relationships related to stakeholder involvement such as those<br>between factors such as perceptions of involvement in system<br>design and administration; actual participation in system design<br>and testing activities; and perceptions of ownership with<br>outcomes such as the extent of data contributed to the system,<br>perceptions of commitment to the system, and significance of<br>organizational resources devoted to participation. Further, we<br>should be able to assess relationships between the perceived<br>amount and quality of information in the system and end user<br>satisfaction, likelihood of returning to the system, and interest in<br>becoming more involved in system activities.  Of course, we will<br>continue to be able to comment anecdotally on what we have<br>learned about the politics of technology diffusion in public sector<br>organizations.</span></nobr></DIV>
