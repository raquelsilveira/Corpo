<DIV style="position:absolute;top:259;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft4">Many authors have recognised the importance of structure in shaping information system (IS) design and use. Structuration theory<br>has been used in IS research and design to assist with the identification and understanding of the structures in which the IS is<br>situated. From a critical theoretical perspective, focusing on the Habermas' theory of communicative action, a community based<br>child health information system was designed and implemented in a municipality in rural South Africa. The structures which shaped<br>and influenced the design of this IS (the restructured health services and social tradition) are explored and discussed. From this case<br>study the implications of using IS design as a developmental tool are raised: namely the development of a shared understanding,<br>the participation of key players and the agreement on joint action.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:536;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">Many authors [Walsham and Sahay 1996; Walsham and Han 1991; Jones 1997; Rose 1999; Orlikowski 1992;<br>Orlikowski and Baroudi 1991; Orlikowski and Robey 1991] have recognised the importance of structure in shaping<br>information system (IS) design and use. Structuration theory has been used in IS research and design to assist<br>with the identification of the structures in which they are situated. Using this meta-analysis tool, information<br>systems have been used to redefine and/or reinforce some of these structures. The IS design process is particularly<br>important, not just in shaping the structures, but also in terms of understanding what structures exist and how<br>they were formed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Critical approaches to IS examine those structures with the perspective of questioning and changing some of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:680;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">them. Critical social researchers seek to emancipate people by finding alternatives to existing social conditions<br>as well as challenging taken-for-granted conditions. In particular, Habermas [1987] examines communication and<br>how through striving for an ideal speech situation these structures can be challenged. In the process of IS design<br>communication is especially important, as is who participates, and how.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:753;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">In this paper the author explores the existing structures which have contributed to the accessibility, or as the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:771;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">case may be inaccessibility, of the health services in the Okhahlamba municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.<br>Through the design of the community-based child health information system these structures were explored and<br>addressed throughout the design process. Communication and participation were integral to the process, as well<br>as the recognition of the importance of the context in which the system is designed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:844;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">The rest of this paper is structured in the following manner. The following section looks at what is meant</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:862;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">by structure, the process of structuration and its application to IS design. The third section looks at critical<br>social theory in IS design, in particular Habermas' notion of communicative action. The fourth section outlines<br>the existing structures in a community in KwaZulu-Natal that were important in shaping the IS design process.<br>The fifth section explores how the process of IS design acknowledged and challenged these structures and the<br>last section discusses the implications for IS design as a developmental tool.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:504;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">In this paper structure is regarded as 'Rules and resources, recursively implicated in the reproduction of social<br>systems. Structure exists only as memory traces, the organic basis of human knowledgeability, and as instantiated<br>in action' [Giddens 1993] p377. That is, through action, based on rules and resources in peoples' minds, structures<br>in society are produced and reproduced. The rules and resources drawn upon in the production and reproduction<br>of action are simultaneously the means of system reproduction (this is what Giddens refers to as the 'duality<br>of structure'). The rules can be viewed as generalised procedures of action and human agents are aware and<br>knowledgeable of these rules, but may not know what the outcome of that action will be because action can have<br>both intended and unintended consequences. The resources are both authoritative (coordination of the activity<br>of human agents) and allocative (control of material aspects of the natural world), so both human and material<br>resources are included.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:684;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">The process of structuration involves knowledgeable actions of human agents discursively and recursively</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:702;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">forming the sets of rules, practices and routines which, over time and space constitute structure. Thus agents<br>and structures are not seen as independent, but as a duality whereby structure is relied upon in human actions,<br>and in so doing structures are produced or reproduced. Over time these social practices becomes reasonably<br>stable and routines develop. Giddens [1993] p29 breaks down social structure and human interaction into three<br>dimensions which are interlinked by three modalities as illustrated in Figure 1.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:792;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">When human actors communicate, they draw on interpretative schemes to help make sense of interactions.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:810;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">At the same time those interactions reproduce and modify those interpretative schemes which are embedded in<br>social structure as meaning or signification. Similarly the human actors allocate resources through use of power,<br>and produce and reproduce social structures of domination. Moral codes or norms help determine what human<br>agents can sanction and thus produce and reproduce social structures of legitimation. It is useful to separate<br>structure and interaction into these three dimensions for analysis of structure, but the dimensions are interlinked.<br>[Rose 1999]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:918;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">The design and use of information systems are shaped by the very structures within which they are situated,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:936;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">but IS can also be used to help define and redefine these structures. By exploring each of the above dimensions<br>in the process of IS design, IS design can be used as a tool for development by refining the structures to include<br>the views and values of those currently disadvantaged by the existing structures. Through a participative and<br>reflective process in IS design, cultural and traditional norms which influences human action can be explained,<br>understood and addressed. The design process, and the IS itself, can improve communication and encourage<br>reflection and change interpretative schemes. Through the process of IS design and reflecting on the situation<br>the excluded can be empowered, which redefines the power and resource structures. In summary IS design can<br>define and refine structures by understanding and incorporating all the dimensions of the duality of structure in<br>the design process.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1098;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Structuration theory has been used quite widely in IS. Rose [1998] conceptualises the use of the theory in IS</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1116;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">for three different purposes: analyse; theorise and operationalise.

In a later article Orlikowski [1992] developed her structurational model of technology to<br>understand the relationship between information technology and institutions.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:451;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">Critical social researchers by their very presence influence and are influenced by the social and technological<br>systems they are studying. 'For critical social theorists, the responsibility of a researcher in a social situation<br>does not end with the development of sound explanations and understandings of it, but must extend to a critique<br>of unjust and inequitable conditions of the situation from which people require emancipation'[Ngwenyama and<br>Lee 1997]p151. Critical social theorists seek to emancipate people; they are concerned with finding alternatives<br>to existing social conditions as well as challenging taken-for-granted conditions. Critical social theorists view<br>people, not as passive receptacles of whatever data or information that is transported to them, but as intelligent<br>actors who assess the truthfulness, completeness, sincerity, and contextuality of the messages they receive.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:594;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Adopting a critical social theoretical perspective to IS design is not new. In relation to IS research Ngwenyama</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:612;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">[1991] gives an in-depth treatment of critical social theory. Ngwenyama and Lee [1997] approach research on<br>communication richness in computer mediated communication from a critical social theoretical perspective.<br>Hirschheim and Klein [1994] deal with a critical approach to qualitative research.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:666;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Habermas [1987] suggests that critical social theorists should initiate a process of self-reflection among human</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:684;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">actors, but it is only participants in the community that can select the appropriate political action. His theory<br>of communicative action notes that all social action assumes a basic set of norms. These norms allow all actors<br>to express themselves fully and openly. They also imply that all actors accept the outcome of open rational<br>argument. According to the theory of communicative action, breakdowns in communication occurs when actors<br>fail to adhere to these norms. There have been numerous studies which refer in particular to the theory of<br>Habermas. Lyytinen [1992] has explored the theory of Habermas to analyse systems development. Hirschheim<br>et al. [1996]using Habermas' theory of communicative action propose a framework for the intellectual trends in<br>IS development research.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:846;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">explore how effective striving for its attainment is as a transformation strategy. My study uses aspects of critical<br>social theory to examine how community action can be strengthened or changed by exploring the structures which<br>enable or constrain that action. Communication, power and norms are key in trying to grasp an understanding<br>of that action. Fundamental to this exploration is the belief that as intelligent and knowledgeable agents, human<br>actors can, within limits, choose to act in accordance with or against societal norms.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:972;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">The existing district health information system in South Africa excludes children and adults that cannot, and/or<br>do not, access the services at the health facilities (clinics, community centres, mobiles and hospitals). Those<br>who are most vulnerable and socially excluded, and need the health support systems the greatest, are the very<br>ones not accessing the health services. Policies are formed and resources allocated to the community based<br>on the information they recieve. Since the vulnerable are excluded from the formal IS they are further and<br>systematically excluded from these policy and resource decisions.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1080;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">With the impact of HIV/AIDS children have increasingly become an excluded and more vulnerable group.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1098;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">This exclusion and vulnerability of children can be tackled on two interconnected levels. The first is through<br>the creation of awareness of the situation of children and the second through the commitment and action of<br>government and society to address this situation. The first can be supported by designing an information system</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:181;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">system, research was conducted on how to develop a community-based health information system that could<br>support a comprehensive district health information system. The research was conducted in Okhahlamba as a<br>component of the child health programme of the uThukela district child survival project and the department of<br>health. Okhahlamba is a municipality of the uThukela district lying in KwaZulu Natal on the eastern coast of<br>South Africa. The primary objective of developing a community-based information system is to assist community<br>members in their decision-making regarding the health of their children. On a secondary level it aims to establish<br>interfaces with the formal health facility information system to enable district managers to use information from<br>the whole district to make informed decisions and policy changes.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:342;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">uation community members, as well as district government staff, recognised their need for a community-based<br>child health information system. To understand what the information needs were, who should be involved in<br>the information system and the format the information should be communicated in a total of 10 interviews, 16<br>focus group discussions and 1 meeting took place between July and September 2002. From the field work there<br>was a greater understanding around the meaning of 'well-being' and 'at-risk' for a child, what factors/practices<br>contribute to these situations, how the situations can be measured and, based on what action can be taken,<br>who the information should go to. Consequently a community-based child health information system has been<br>integrated into the district health information system.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:504;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">are outlined, namely restructuring of health services and status of child health, and social traditions. The first<br>aspect provided an opportunity for change and reflection on the current role and function of the IS whilst also<br>providing an understanding of the exclusion of segments of the population. The second aspect again provides an<br>understanding of the position of women and children in society which impacts on IS design as well as presents<br>some challenges in the design process.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:649;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">After 1994 the national Health Plan for South Africa and the Reconstruction and Development Programme<br>outlined that a Primary Health Care (PHC) approach is the underlying philosophy for the restructuring of<br>the health system. Crucial to this is the role of the community in the development of a district health system<br>emphasising the movement from a traditionally vertical curative based health system to a newer client centred and<br>preventive based health system. In addition, more recently, there has been the move towards the decentralisation<br>of health service delivery (along with other basic social services) to local authorities from the department of health.<br>The newly established structures, such as the community health committees and community health forums, have<br>meant a renegotiation of roles and responsibilities at the district level. This requires active communication<br>between the parties involved to ensure consent on the new roles and responsibilities of all local government staff<br>[uThukela District Child Survival Project 2000b; 2000a].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:829;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Since 1994 children have benefited from the move to PHC. However the free health care policy is not without</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:847;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">its fair share of problems. Due to the emphasis on PHC, there has been a 30% increase in clinic attendance and<br>a 2% increase in hospital attendance in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The additional drugs and personnel<br>needed for the increased attendance at the clinics was not budgeted correctly. As a result the quality of services<br>in terms of shortages of personnel and drugs has been compromised as well as putting severe strain on the budget.<br>Clinics in particular have struggled to accommodate the increased number of clients. Clients also complain that<br>hospital-based health workers are often unsympathetic to their needs. [uThukela District Child Survival Project<br>1999b]</span></nobr></DIV>

They have greater distances to walk and fewer health personnel to cater for them.<br>KwaZulu-Natal is one of two provinces with especially poor client-to-clinic ratios (23,000 clients per clinic) and<br>in 1995 only 54.3% of households in KwaZulu-Natal were within 5 kms of medical care, the second lowest in the<br>country.[Crisp and Ntuli 1999]</span></nobr></DIV>

The government has however committed<br>itself to increasing access to water and sanitation. In spite of two major dams and several springs in the area,<br>a serious shortage of water for agriculture and clean drinking water has impacted nearly every household, and<br>influenced the health status of the area. The cholera epidemic in 2001 is evident of this poor access. A situational<br>analysis for the Okhahlamba municipality completed in July 1998 estimates that only 25% of the population<br>live within 15 minutes walking distance of safe water, and only 25% have adequate sanitary facilities.

Traditional leaders are highly<br>respected, though there is some controversy over the roles and powers being eroded with the formation of the new<br>local government structures.

Much of each day involves several hours of strenuous manual labour, hauling water and<br>firewood, and performing agricultural work. Women, including mothers, grandmothers and older 'girl children',<br>are predominantly responsible for childcare [uThukela District Child Survival Project 1999b]. However if the<br>health-seeking or care decision involves any financial decisions the head of the household, which is usually a<br>man, will need to be consulted in order to make the final decision. This process often causes a delay in a child<br>attending a clinic as money for transport and alternative child care for the siblings would need to be sourced.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:865;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">One of the fundamental steps that needed to be addressed before addressing the situation of children, and how<br>this was reflected in information systems, was a paradigm shift. It required a shift from the older focus on<br>curative centre based service delivery to the newer health services approach which focuses on prevention, clients<br>and quality. To support this paradigm shift the project adapted a new approach of transformational thinking, or<br>future focussed approach, developed in the business sector, but which is also being integrated in health systems.<br>The approach focuses on working towards holistic well-being for all, rather than just solving health associated<br>problems. Through community meetings and discussions the community determined a vision for their children:<br>'To achieve optimal health, growth, development and well-being of children within the family and community in<br>the uThukela Health district'.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1026;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">The implications of the paradigm shift for IS was that though it was important to measure children's physical</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1044;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">condition, it was also important to measure how far towards our vision we are. So instead of saying 80% of our<br>children are immunised, we would say that we still need to immunise 20% of our children. This approach reflects<br>what we still need to do to attain our vision and thus, hopefully, stimulate action. Adopting a forward looking<br>perspective also stresses the importance of the context we are presently in and the importance of measuring<br>changes in that context. Monitoring the context and acting based on that information, should lead to a situation<br>where most children in the future would find themselves in a state of 'well-being'.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:222;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">the context in which the child is placed. In the case study these key people were: the community health<br>workers, parents, family members, early childhood and creche teachers, home based carers, caretakers, social<br>workers, health facility staff, clinic health committees, councillors, government officials and staff from external<br>organisations. This indicates that a multi-leveled and multi-sectoral group affects the situation of children at<br>community level.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:312;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">What was also important was a common understanding by all parties on what was meant by 'well-being' and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:330;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">'at-risk' as the monitoring of these situations and conditions would be important if we were to measure whether<br>we were on the right track to attaining our vision. Meanings of 'well-being' and 'at-risk' were gathered through<br>focus-group discussions, interviews and meetings with all the role players and duty bearers. This common<br>understanding was translated into common data definitions in the community-based, as well as in the health<br>facility, information system.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:420;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">A review of the existing data sources and flows was conducted based on the assumption that information flows</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:438;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">are a key element of dialogue between providers and consumers of health services. One important conclusion<br>from this review was that some of the data collected through the current district health information system is<br>valid and useful, but is not getting to the people who can act upon or use it. As one project leader mentioned we<br>need to look at how data is flowing and the possibility of establishing 'feedback pathways' for this data. There<br>are many of these pathways at different levels, but the one between community based workers and community<br>forums is core for a community-based health information system. This level of feedback was entirely absent from<br>the district health information system in Okhahlamba.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">It is also interesting to note what was absent from existing data sets, yet what key role players and duty</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:581;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">bearers felt were important in monitoring the situation of their children. Data items relating to the context in<br>which a child is being reared are mostly excluded. Many of the current indicators focus on the condition the<br>child is currently in, such as having immunisation or not, and not the context that caused the child to be in that<br>situation, such as no caregiver to take the child to the clinic. But exclusion is a process and to prevent the child<br>becoming excluded requires analysing the situation of the child throughout that process. Measures for context,<br>such as happiness, playfulness and communication are more intangible and therefore difficult to develop as data<br>items. However through the new observation tools developed by and for the community health worker these<br>measures are now included. So data items on the presence of a caregiver, drug and alcohol abuse, cleanliness of<br>the household for example, are now included as indicators of 'at-risk'. This observation tool is used as part of<br>the dialogue between the health worker, who is a trusted and respected family advisor, and the household. The<br>results from the aggregated monthly data is shared through role play, song, dance, drawings and histograms in<br>the community quarterly meetings. The act of sharing information establishes networks of people at community<br>level who are responsible for the care of the children. These networks form the basis for communication.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">In terms of capacity to act, or to make decisions, most respondents, in the research undertaken, felt that they<br>could act if given appropriate information and if key role players were included in the communication loop with<br>one another. The visioning exercise started a communication process, but this needed to be developed into more<br>formal communication structures. Communication was needed with other levels of government. Building on<br>the recent development of clinic health committees and the governments' appointment of the community health<br>workers in the KwaZulu-Natal province, communication loops were developed. These loops are described below<br>at three levels: household, community, and district.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:202;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7">facilitators), conduct village health days for discussion of broader issues affecting the community served by the<br>clinic. Bar graphs, role-plays, song, poetry and dance are used as these methods seem to work very well. These<br>meetings form the quarterly community health meetings, that were suggested in the course of the field work.<br>Members of the community and the clinic health committee, health facility staff, community health worker,<br>school children and other key people attend the meetings. More people have now access to the information<br>they requested and in a format that is easy to understand. The village health days also provide a forum for<br>reflection and discussion.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:331;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft1">--District level: Communication and information flows between community and district involves combining data</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:349;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7">from various sources to provide a comprehensive database for the district. Important for the collation of this<br>data is the use of the same data definitions in the different data sources. This collation is done through the<br>district information officer as her office already receives this data from the different sectors. A summary of<br>the district data is distributed every quarter. The content of the summary sheet is regularly determined in<br>consultation with the clinic health committees and through feedback on the village health days. Existing<br>local government structures, community and clinic committees, have already established clear communication<br>channels with higher levels of local government. The feedback from these meetings would be sent through<br>these structures when needed. Thus a comprehensive picture of child health in the district is achieved.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">In summary, with the restructuring of the health services there was the need for a paradigm shift, before<br>addressing the review and design of a community-based child health information system. This shift was from the<br>older more curative health service approach to the newer client and service focused approach of primary health<br>care. With the newly established local clinic and community health committees this offered an opportunity of<br>new people coming into the health services with a new vision and who were also willing to be involved in the IS<br>design process. Furthermore the newly formed local government structures have established clear communication<br>channels with higher levels of local government. The feedback from quarterly community health meetings could<br>be sent through these channels and forms part of the health information flow and communication loop.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:645;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Challenges around the position of women in society impacted on decisions regarding participation. However as</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">women are the main carers of children they were involved in the process without any question. Furthermore as<br>some of the key positions in the community are occupied by men it was also felt that they needed to participate<br>in the design process as their positions were influential in terms of the situation of children in the community.<br>The dialogue initiated in the design process continues through the community health quarterly meetings which<br>provide an opportunity for dialogue to take place at community level. At the household level the community<br>health workers role is to empower the household in its health seeking and caring practices. This is done through<br>household visits and providing the appropriate education at the appropriate time, for example if a child has<br>diarrhoea the conversation would be around what to do for the child with diarhoea. The community health worker<br>also plays the role of mediator - mediator between households and the community forum and also between the<br>caregiver and the rest of the family. Through the supportive role of the community health worker the position<br>of women and children will not change in society, but their views on health and the care of children will be<br>supported and heard.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:878;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">The process of IS design in the case study supported and questioned two key aspects of structure, namely the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:896;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">restructuring of health services and the status of child health and social traditions and their implications on the<br>process of the design.

Participation of the excluded increases transparency and opens officials and other<br>responsible parties to dialogue and wider scrutiny by the citizens they serve. Underlying power differences<br>between different actors influences the interaction and negotiation between them (both within the community<br>and between the community and outside groups) and this can influence whose 'interests' are explored and served<br>in information systems.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:846;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">Communication provides the means for exploring, affirming or denying norms, debating policies and practices,<br>and discussing old experiences and new ideas. The situation of children will change only when action to improve<br>that situation is taken. So the next step was to explore what will happen once the information has been shared.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:937;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">Once the vision is formulated then the necessary action to attain that vision needs to be agreed to. Often this<br>involves a multi-leveled and multi-sectoral approach. It also needs all key role players to be in communication<br>with one another. It is not easy to challenge or change the institutions and systems established that support the<br>status quo.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:1026;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">most difficult task was achieving agreement by these role players on their action. Most of the confusion was<br>over formal roles and responsibilities which had changed with the recent moves to decentralization of basic social<br>services to local authorities, rather than an unwillingness to support one another. With this move the community<br>health workers had also recently moved from a local non-governmental organization to the Department of Health<br>and were confused over their reporting structures. The district department of health needs to hand over delivery<br>of health services to local authorities, but the local authority does not have the human nor financial capacity<br>to carry out this function. The volunteer clinic health committees are enthusiastic to support initiatives that</span></nobr></DIV>

The recent changes have provided an opportunity for inclusion<br>of children on the agenda as many of the structures and systems are not, or have only recently, been formed.<br>What was encouraging from the field work was that most people felt that they had the capability to act if they<br>received the information.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:253;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft1">CONCLUSION</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:276;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft8">It is increasingly recognised that globalisation also produces marginalisation. Castells [2000b; 2000a] argues<br>that processes of globalisation are extremely selective, and various parts of the globe in both the developing<br>and developed world run the potential of being excluded from this process. He uses the term 'fourth world' to<br>describe this segment of society. Conditions of history and geography shape the access that groups and societies<br>have to new information and communication technologies. Lack of such access can be exclusionary. Castells<br>describes these processes to be systematic and can lead to further marginalisation and exclusion of societies.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:384;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">In information systems, and not just health information systems, the voices of communities - in particular</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:402;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">women, children and youth - are not often heard, both within communities, between communities and between<br>the other levels of society. When, where and how do they get the opportunity to express their needs and<br>aspirations? How do they have the chance to identify and develop the skills and resources they need to address<br>their problems? Where do they get the opportunity to express themselves or to exchange ideas and experience?<br>In a sub-district in KwaZulu-Natal these questions have been addressed through a holistic approach to health<br>information systems development.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:510;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Some of the challenges for IS design is the need to focus both on the output, as well as the process. Attaining a</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:528;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">common vision is fundamental if the system is to be used, but this involves the participation of different sectors<br>and different levels of actors from the outset. It also offers some opportunities. Clarification over roles and<br>responsibilities allows recognition and acceptance by duty bearers of the tasks they need to perform. This is<br>a first step towards action. There was great enthusiasm by these key role players in the design process and a<br>desire to work together. The community monitoring system in Okhahlamba was based on an understanding that<br>people are intelligent and know what affects their children's and their own development. There is the need to<br>co-design systems, processes and tools in IS design and obtain clarity on what we need to measure. IS design<br>should be about facilitating a journey of development, rather than measuring the destination.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:671;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1">Communication and participation, as well as the capacity to do so, are needed to strive towards Habermas'</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:689;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7">ideal speech situation. This is no easy task, as exclusion is built upon a system of norms, interpretative schema<br>and facilities that systematically excludes segments of the population and country from the network society.<br>Communication will not simply be improved by introducing a new or improved health information system. Even<br>so, a process from visioning, developing skills and capacity and constructing a conducive environment can mean<br>that IS design can be viewed as a development tool, as striving towards this 'ideal speech situation', even if this<br>situation is not attained.</span></nobr></DIV>
