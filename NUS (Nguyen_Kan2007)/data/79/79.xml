<SECTION header="Abstract">We propose an indexing technique for the fast retrieval
of objects in 2D images basedon similarity between
their boundary shapes. Our technique is robust in the presence
of noise andsupports several important notions of similarity
including optimal matches irrespective of variations in
orientation and/or position. Our method can also handle size-invariant
matches using a normalization technique, although
optimality is not guaranteedhere. We implementedour method
and performed experiments on real (hand-written digits) data.
Our experimental results showedthe superiority of our method
comparedto search basedon sequential scanning, which is the
only obvious competitor. The performance gain of our method
increases with any increase in the number or the size of shapes.

<SECTION header="Introduction">There is an increasing interest in storing andretrieving non-textual
objects in databases. For example, this kind of data can
be storedin the form of extenders in DB2, DataBlades in In-formix
, and cartridges in Oracle. Non-textual objects are frequently
in the form of images or shapes. In cases where the key
information for description or classification of an object can be
found in its boundary, it is natural to store only the boundary
anddo retrieval basedon that. Among the areas of applications
for boundary shape matching are industrial inspection,
object recognition in satellite images, character recognition,
classification of chromosomes, andtarget recognition.
For example, consider the following query:
Query 1
Findall shapes similar to a given shape.
A basic question here is how we judge whether two shapes
(for example the two shown in Fig. 1) are similar. There is a
large body of work in the area of pattern recognition and computer
vision on extracting boundary features of a shape and
doing shape matching based on those features. The boundary
of an object can be described in terms of simple descriptors
such as length, diameter, and curvature ([MM86]), chain
Fig. 1.
Two shape boundaries both representing character `9'
codes ([BG80,Bri81]), Fourier descriptors ([PF77,ZR72]) or
moments ([BSA91]). Among these features, we use Fourier
descriptors as our shape features. Theoretical andexperimen-tal
evidence in favor of Fourier descriptors can be found in the
literature [PF77,KSP95].
Similar shapes often have differences in size and orientation
. For example, consider the two shapes shown in Fig. 1. The
Euclidean distance between their Fourier descriptors is 22.88.
If we rotate the shape on the right by
30

in the clockwise
(cw) direction, the Euclidean distance between their Fourier
descriptors drops to zero. A simple approach to remove differences
due to shifting, scaling, and rotation is to normalize
Fourier descriptors before storing them in a database. However
, there are still two problems with normalization. First,
normalization is not guaranteedto minimize the distance between
two arbitrary shapes. Second, normalization is not always
desirable; for example, the shapes `9' and`6' shouldnot
be treatedas similar if we are doing character recognition. A
solution is to rewrite the query as follows:
Query 2
Findall shapes that become similar to a given shape
after being rotatedby
[-30

, 30

].
If our shape collection includes, for example, shapes of airplanes
, we may write our query insteadas follows:
Query 3
Findall shapes similar to a given shape irrespective
of rotation.
In this paper, we study the issue of efficiently processing
these queries. We show how to organize Fourier descriptors in
a multidimensional index, and how to efficiently use the index

to develop an access method that can handle shapes of various
sizes andorientations, is much faster than sequential scanning,
and does not miss any qualifying data objects in the answers
(false positives are acceptable if they can be eliminatedin a
post-processing step without much performance degradation).
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows.

<SECTION header="Background">2.1 Related work
The following relevant methods for multidimensional indexing
andsearch have been proposed:
Jagadish [Jag91] proposes a technique for storing and retrieving
shape descriptions in a multidimensional index. He
maps shapes into their constituent rectangles, keeps a few
larger rectangles in a multidimensional index, and uses the
area difference between the constituent rectangles of shapes
as a measure of similarity. Due to a normalization process, the
shape description is invariant under translation and scaling. A
problem with this approach is that a shape can be normally
coveredby multiple sets of rectangles. This can leadto ambiguity
or storing multiple representations of the same shape.
Furthermore, it is not possible to do matching in the presence
of rotation; for example, two identical shapes may not match
if one is rotatedby
45

.
Mehrotra andGary [MG93] decompose a shape into several
components anduse fixed-sizedsegments of each component
as the shape features. Basedon a normalization process,
the shape description is made invariant under translation, scaling
, androtation. A problem with this approach is that since
a shape is broken down into pieces, the overall shape of the
boundary is lost. In addition, each shape is described in terms
of multiple feature vectors, andthis introduces extra overhead
during insertions and retrievals.
Berchtoldet al. [BKK97] study the issue of storing polygons
so that they can be retrievedbasedon partial similarity
matches. They extract almost all possible boundary segments
of polygons, transform each segment into a sequence of slope
changes, andmap the resulting sequences into their first few
Fourier coefficients. Thus, each polygon is representedusing
a set of feature points, andthe minimum bounding rectangle
of these points for each polygon is storedin a multidimensional
index. Due to a normalization, the shape representation
is invariant to translation, scaling, androtation, but it is not invariant
to the starting point. This problem is handled by storing
multiple descriptions of a polygon, each associated to a
starting point. Again, representing a polygon in terms of multiple
points introduces extra overhead during insertions and
retrievals.
The QBIC (Query By Image Content) system [FBF
+
94]
contains a component for approximate shape matching. The
system keeps a 20-D feature vector to describe the shape of

A boundary and its representation as a complex sequence
every object identified in an image. Features, for example, include
the area and the circularity, i.e., whether the object is circular
or not. To allow fast retrieval, it is suggestedto transform
feature vectors using the Karhunen Loeve (KL) transform and
keep a few important features (those associatedwith the few
largest eigenvalues) in a multidimensional index. However, the
choice of proper features andtheir weighting for each application
is not an easy task. Some features are abstract quantities
which may not easily fit in a distance function computation.
In addition, the use of the KL transform makes the multidimensional
index rather static.
The aforementionedmethods are less general than ours because
the notion of similarity is fixedbefore query evaluation;
this notion cannot be changedunless a new index structure
is created. Our method, instead, provides a set of transformations
to express the notion of similarity in a query; yet, the
resulting queries are evaluatedusing the same index, without
prior knowledge of the specific transformations used. Therefore
we have not comparedthe performance of our method
with theirs, but with sequential scanning instead.
Related work on time series data includes the work of
Agrawal et al. [AFS93] on using the discrete Fourier transform
for retrieving similar time series andextensions andimprove-ments
over this approach [GK95,RM97,RM00]. Similar to
our framework, Goldin and Kanellakis [GK95] show that the
similarity retrieval will be roughly invariant to simple translations
andscales if sequences are normalizedbefore being
stored in the index. The authors store in the index both the
translation and the scale factors, in addition to normalized sequences
, andalso allow those factors to be queriedusing range
predicates (see Goldin's Ph.D. thesis [Gol97] for implementation
details).
A general framework for composing similarity queries is
proposed by Jagadish, Mendelzon, and Milo [JMM95]. Our
work here can be seen as a special case of this framework over
shapes. Our shape matching can also be incorporatedwithin a
multimedia query language such as MOQL [L ¨
OSO97] where
multiple features of images are simultaneously queried.
2.2 Shape representation using Fourier descriptors
Given the figure of an object in the complex plane, its boundary
can be tracedproducing a 1-D complex function
b
t
of
time. For example, a point moving along the boundary shown
in Fig. 2 generates the complex function
b
t
= x
t
+ jy
t
for
D. Rafiei, A.O. Mendelzon: Efficient retrieval of similar shapes
19
t = 0, . . . , N - 1 which is periodic with period N. That is, the
x-axis of the figure is treatedas the real axis andthe y-axis as
the imaginary axis of a sequence of complex numbers. Further
information on tracing the boundary of a shape and possible
alternatives in representing it can be foundin any image processing
textbook such as Gonzalez andWoods [GW92].
It shouldbe notedthat the description is solely basedon
the shape of the boundary; objects can still have holes in them,
but this is not reflected in the description. Given a boundary
function
b
t
, its Fourier transform can be written as
B
f

where
f  { (N - 1)/2 , . . . , 0, . . . , (N - 1)/2 } and
j = -1 is the imaginary unit. The coefficients B

, B

, . . .,
called Fourier descriptors, describe the shape of the object in
the frequency domain. The transformation is loss-less since
the energy in the frequency domain is the same as the energy
in the spatial domain (due to Parseval's theorem) and also the
inverse Fourier transform gives the original boundary function
.
2.3 Shape matching using Fourier descriptors
Consider two boundary functions
b
t
= x
t

and
b

=
x

(for
t = 0, . . . , N -1).A typical measure of similarity
between the two boundaries is the Euclidean distance, which
corresponds to mean-square error and which is also directly
relatedto the cross-correlation [Raf98].

However, the distance computation becomes ambiguous if the
two boundaries have different numbers of samples. A solution
to avoidthis problem is to findthe Fourier descriptors
B and

frequency descriptors (say,
2M +1) to compute the Euclidean

<SECTION header="Our proposal">The general overview of the proposedmethodis as follows:
1. Obtain the Fourier descriptors of every shape boundary in
the database.
2. Compute a fingerprint for every shape, as discussed in
Sect. 3.1, andbuilda multidimensional index using the
fingerprints. Each fingerprint is storedas a point in the
multidimensional index.
3. For basic similarity queries (proximity, nearest neighbours
and all-pairs), use the index to retrieve candidate shapes.
The qualifying shapes are identified after retrieving their
full database records and examining them.
4. For queries that use transformations in their expressions
of similarities, if necessary, apply the transformations to
the index, as discussed in Sect. 3.4, and retrieve candidate
shapes. The full database record of every candidate shape
is examinedto findout if it qualifies.
We use Fourier descriptors as our shape features. Given a
set of shape boundaries, for each boundary
b we findits Fourier
transform andretain only a fixednumber of lower frequency
descriptors. This number, which we denote by
2M + 1, can
be chosen, for example to be the average length of a boundary
in the spatial domain. If the number of Fourier descriptors
happens to be less than
2M + 1, we store zero for higher
frequency descriptors.
3.1 Computing a fingerprint
To aidin the retrievals that we intendto perform, we apply a
few transformations to the descriptors, rather than storing them
directly. First, we set
B
0
to
0. B
0
is the only descriptor that
carries information about the shape location. This setting minimizes
the distance function (Eq. 3) with respect to translation.
Next, the scale normalization is achieved by dividing every
coefficient
B
f
by the amplitude of
B
1
, often calledthe fundamental
frequency.
|B
1
| turns out to be the largest amplitude
when the boundary is traced in the counter-clockwise (ccw)
direction and the boundary does not cross itself [WW80]. After
the normalization,
B
0
is
0, so we do not need to store it.
Instead, we store the original value of
B
0
before the normalization
. It shouldbe notedthat the real andthe imaginary parts of
the initial value of
B
0
represent the shift factors, respectively,
along the X and the Y coordinates; the amplitude of the initial
value of
B
1
represents the scale factor. To totally get ridof
B
1
, which already has an amplitude of
1 for all shapes, we do
an additional normalization. We shift the starting point such
that the phase of
B
1
becomes zero.
Definition 3.1. Given the Fourier descriptors

follows:

Such a description is still sensitive to changes in orientation
andstarting point of the tracing. We can assume that every
data or query shape has a fixed starting point, if we encode its
boundary using the same tracing algorithm and perform the
same normalization. For example, a tracing algorithm may
always start from the top right corner of a shape andtrace it
in the ccw direction. In this way, the starting point for two
identical shapes will always be the same. Two similar shapes
20
D. Rafiei, A.O. Mendelzon: Efficient retrieval of similar shapes
may still have small variations in their starting points, but those
variations can be easily resolvedby allowing some variations
in starting points. This is discussed in Sect. 3.4.3.
There are sophisticatedtechniques to do phase normalization
[PF77,WW80]. For example, Wallace et al. [WW80]
suggest making the phases of the two coefficients of largest
amplitude equal to zero. This is believed to shift the starting
point over the axis of symmetry andalso rotate the axis of
symmetry such that it coincides with the real axis. However,
it shouldbe notedthat none of these techniques are perfect in
the sense that a shape can have two or more different phase
normalizations, each as goodas the others; or equivalently,
two fairly similar shapes may have descriptors which are far
from each other.
For the purpose of indexing, important features of the description
needto be identifiedandplacedin the fingerprint.
First, changing the orientation or the starting point of a boundary
only affects the phases of descriptors. To insulate the index
from such changes, the information about the phases of
descriptors is not stored in a fingerprint. Second, as is shown
in Fig. 3, the lower frequency descriptors contain information
about the general shape, andthe higher frequency descriptors
contain information about smaller details. There are strong
reasons to believe that for a large class of boundary functions,
the lower frequency descriptors contain most of the energy.
For example, for continuous piece-wise smooth functions, the
amplitude spectrum
|S
f
| decreases at a rate proportional to
f
-2
[RH74, Page 373]. Thus, we can define a fingerprint of a
shape as follows:
Definition 3.2. Given a shape description
(sh
x
, sh
y
, sc, S
-1
,
S
2
, S
-2
, . . . , S
M
, S
-M
), the fingerprint of the shape is defined
as
(sh
x
, sh
y
, sc, |S
-1
|, |S
2
|, |S
-2
|, . . . , |S
k
|, |S
-k
|) where
k ( M) is the cut-off frequency.
Next we show the completeness of the feature extraction.
3.2 Using fingerprints for indexing
The completeness of the indexing methodis basedon the following
lemma:
Lemma 3.3. The use of a fingerprint, in place of a full shape
description for shape matching always returns a superset of
the answer set.
Proof: For every pair of boundaries
S and S of length
2M + 1 andfor every k  M, we have
M
f=-M,f=0,1
|S
f
- S
f
|
2

k
f=-k,f=0,1
||S
f
| - |S
f
||
2
(6)
This is due to the fact that for every term
||S
f
| - |S
f
|| in
the right side of the inequality, there is a term
|S
f
- S
f
| in the
left side and
|S
f
- S
f
|  ||S
f
| - |S
f
||.
Thus, storing the fingerprints of shapes in the index does
not affect the correctness since the index returns a superset of
the answer set. Furthermore, the distance function on the right
side of Eq. 6 is invariant to changes in the starting point of the
boundary and rotation.
However, the index will not be effective if the choice of
k results in a large number of false hits or high index dimensionality
(the curse of dimensionality). Our experiments in
Sect. 4.2 show that the value of
k can be chosen as low as 2
which results in storing 5 Fourier amplitudes in the index.
There are a large number of multidimensional data structures
which can be used for indexing (see the survey by Gaede
andG¨unther [GG98] for details). We use the R*-tree as it is
expectedto work well for up to 20 dimensions andthe length
of a fingerprint is expectedto be less than 20.
3.3 Basic similarity queries
Within this section, we assume that the shapes being com-paredhave
the correct sizes, positions, andorientations. Such a
match can also be useful, for example before insertions, to prevent
storing two replicas of the same image. We consider the
three basic similarity queries over a shape database: (a) proximity
query
1
; (b) all-pairs query; and(c) nearest-neighbours
query.
In a proximity query, we are given a query shape anda
threshold , andwe wouldlike to findall database shapes
that are within distance
of the query shape. To perform a
proximity query, both the shape description and its fingerprint
are computedas describedin Sect. 3.1, in the same way as each
data shape has been. The fingerprint is then used as a search
key into the shape index, to retrieve all data shapes that are
locatedin its proximity. Note that the index retrieves a superset
of the answer set since it only keeps the fingerprints of shape
descriptions. The actual result is obtained in an additional step
where the Euclidean distance between the full database record
of every matching shape andthe query shape is computed.
In an all-pairs query, we are given two data sets and a
threshold , andwe want to findall pairs of shapes such that
one shape is within distance of the other. To perform an all-pairs
query, we do a spatial join between the corresponding
indices of the two data sets. This is followed by an additional
step where the Euclidean distance between the full database
records of matching shapes are computed.
In a nearest-neighbours query, we are given a query shape,
andwe wish to finddata shapes which are the closest to
the query shape in distance. To perform a nearest-neighbours
query, both the shape description and its fingerprint are computed
(as discussedin Sect. 3.1), andthe fingerprint is usedas
a search key over the index. Since the index employs the distance
between fingerprints for its pruning andthis distance is
an underestimate of the real distance between descriptions, a
nearest neighbour identified through searching the index may
not be the real nearest neighbour. For example, of the two
shapes a and b, a couldbe the closest to the query shape based
on the distance between full descriptions, but the index will
return b if b is the closest basedon the distance between fingerprints
.
To fix the problem, we pick the nearest neighbour(s) iden-tifiedthrough
the index andcompute the distances between
full descriptions of the retrievedshapes andthe query shape.
If we denote the minimum distance over all retrieved shapes
with , the distance from the real nearest neighbours cannot

This is often referredto as a range query as well [AFS93,LJF94].

Example of reconstructions from Fourier descriptors

index are the nearest neighbours. The full algorithm is as follows
:
Algorithm 1:
1. Using a nearest-neighbours search algorithm (such as
[RKV95]), retrieve the nearest neighbour(s) from the index
.
2. For every candidate returned in step 1, retrieve its full
database recordandcompute its real distance from the
query shape. Let NN be the set of all data shapes at the
minimum real distances from the query shape; let be this
minimum distance.
3. Using
as an initial threshold, pose an incremental proximity
query to the index (results are returned one at a time
andthe threshold can be tightenedduring the process).
4. Get the next data shape within distance
of the query
shape. If the distance between the data shape and the query
shape is less than , then set NN to be the new data shape
and
to be the new distance; if the distance between the
new data shape and the query shape is , then add the new
data shape to NN. Repeat this step until there are no more
qualifying data shapes.
Algorithm 1 is a refinement of the nearest-neighbours algorithm
given by Korn et al. [KSF
+
96]. The refinement is in
the form of tightening the proximity query thresholdin Step 4
as more data shapes are retrieved. There is another incremental
refinement of the same algorithm, proposedby Seidl and
Kriegel [SK98], which can also be used.
3.4 Queries with transformations
A natural way of doing shape matching is to remove certain
differences before running a comparison. We can think of this
process as applying certain transformations to images before
doing a matching. We consider the following four kinds of
transformations:
1. Shifting andscaling.
2. Rotation.
3. Change of starting point.
4. Smoothing.
In this section, we center our discussion on proximity queries,
but the same techniques are applicable to nearest-neighbours
andall-pairs queries.
Transformations 1 to 3 can be supportedin a multidimensional
index by providing a function that computes the distance
between a data shape and a query shape; transformations can
be applied to shape descriptions inside the function. Transformation
4 can be supported by registering an additional function
that checks if an index entry overlaps with a query entry. The
transformation can then be appliedto either the index entry or
the query entry (or both) before checking for an overlap. Most
multidimensional index structures allow users to define such
a function.
The next four subsections respectively discuss the eval-uations
of queries that use individual transformations 1 to 4
in their expressions of similarities. More details on evaluating
queries that use a combination of transformations in their
expressions of similarities can be foundelsewhere [RM00].
3.4.1 Match with shifting or scaling
In many cases we do not care about the position of a shape
within a coordinate system or about its size for matching purposes
.
To match with shifting or scaling, a fingerprint is com-putedfor
the query shape, as describedin Sect. 3.1, andthis
fingerprint is usedas a search key for the index. If we are interested
in a match invariant under shifting, we simply discard
the shift factor of the query point andpermit any value for the
shift factor. Similarly, for scaling-invariant matching, we dis-cardthe
scale factor of the query point andpermit any value
for the scale factor.
22
D. Rafiei, A.O. Mendelzon: Efficient retrieval of similar shapes
3.4.2 Match with rotation
We often wish to match shapes irrespective of small variations
in orientation. For example, the two shapes shown in Fig. 1
make a perfect match, if one shape is rotatedby
30

. To achieve
this, we state in our query the range of the rotation we wish to
perform before doing a shape matching. Query 2, for instance,
retrieves all database shapes that match a given query shape
after one shape is being rotatedby
[-30

, 30

].
Sometimes, we wouldlike to do matching totally invariant
to rotation. For example, we may not care about the orientation
at all if we are doing airplane recognition. This can be accom-plishedby
simply allowing a rotation of
[-180

, 180

]
before matching.
To perform a match with rotation, a fingerprint is computed
for the query shape andis usedas a search key to the index. The
search key is used to retrieve all candidates from the index.
These candidates include all data points that match the query
point irrespective of rotation factor. They also include false
positives, i.e., data points that are not in the proximity of the
query point for any rotation factor. To discard false positives,
we need to retrieve the full database record of every candidate
andcheck whether it actually falls in the proximity (say within
distance ) of the query shape after being rotatedby some
[
1
,
2
]. On the other hand, rotating a shape boundary by
is equivalent to multiplying every descriptor S

can thus rewrite Eq. 5 to make it reflect the rotation.

which is inside the region. It is straightforward to compute
the distance function for these values andfindout the optimal
rotation factor that results in the minimum distance.
3.4.3 Match with changing starting point
When we compare two boundaries, we do not care about their
starting points. If we use the same tracing algorithm for every
boundary, there cannot be large variations in the starting point
(though small variations are still possible). However, we may
not have much control over the tracing algorithm, andas a
result two similar shapes may have different starting points;
or even if we use the same tracing algorithm for all boundaries,
we may want to remove small variations (if any) before doing
a comparison.
Shifting the starting point of a boundary by

descriptors. Thus, we can still use the index to retrieve all
candidates. To discard false positives, we need to retrieve the
full database record of every candidate and check whether it
still qualifies after the starting point is being shiftedby some

3.4.4 Match with smoothing
Occasionally, we wish to do matching based on overall shape,
irrespective of small variations in details and noise. In such
cases, we wouldlike to smooth out sharp edges andsmall variations
before doing the comparison. To achieve this, we can
apply a moving average transformation to shape boundaries.
When an l-point moving average is appliedto a boundary,
every point is replacedwith the average of its l surrounding
points. On the other hand, applying a moving average to a
boundary in the spatial domain corresponds to a vector multiplication
in the frequency domain. For example, to apply a
2-point moving average to a boundary with 10 points, we can
equivalently multiply its Fourier descriptors by the Fourier
transform of vector
m
2
= (
1
2
,
1
2
, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). This
gives us the Fourier descriptors of the smoothed boundary.
A distinguishing feature of smoothing, compared to other
transformations discussed in this paper, is that its effect on
a shape depends on the characteristics of the shape. This is
unlike rotation, for instance, where the effect of rotating a
data shape by
before a comparison is the same as that of
rotating the query shape by
-.
Given a query shape anda desiredmoving average for
smoothing, the matching can be performedas follows:
1. Findthe Fourier transform of the desiredmoving average
(as demonstrated for 2-point moving average); let us
denote this by
M.
2. Transforming the query shape: Apply the transformation to
the query shape description
(sh
x
, sh
y
, sc, Q) by replacing
Q with Q where Q
i
= Q
i
M
i
for
i = -1, -2, 2, . . . ,
-k, k.
3. Construct a search key by computing the fingerprint of the
new shape description.
4. Transforming the index: Apply
M to data entries stored in
the index before checking for an overlap between a data
entry and the search key; this is done inside the function
that checks if a data entry from the index overlaps the
search key.
5. For every candidate, retrieve its full database record, apply
M to it andcheck if the resulting shape falls in the
proximity of
Q .
The transformation can be appliedto the index on the fly as
the index is being traversed. The issue of on-the-fly applying
single or multiple transformations to an index is studied
in the domain of time series data [RM97,RM00]. The same
techniques can be appliedto the domain of shapes.

<SECTION header="Experiments">To determine the effectiveness of our proposed technique, we
implementedour methodandran experiments on a dataset
of 11,000 real hand-written digits. The data was obtained
from the CEDAR CDROM dataset, which was gathered from
scannedZIP codes at the Buffalo Post Office [Hul94]. For
every digit, the dataset held 1,100 images. Each image was
originally in the form of a 16
×16 gray-scale image which
was convertedinto a binary image (by thresholding) andwas
traced to identify a shape boundary. Then, the boundary was
encoded using 30 lower Fourier descriptors. For boundaries
with length less than 30, zero was padded at the end. For each
shape, both its description and its fingerprint are computed,
as outlinedin Sect. 3.1, andusedfor the purpose of indexing.
As our index, we used Norbert Beckmann's implementation
of the R*-tree [BKSS90]. For the nearest-neighbours search,
we implementedthe algorithm developedby Roussopoulos et
al. [RKV95] as part of Algorithm 1 over R*-tree. We stored
10,000 shapes (1,000 samples of each digit) in the index and
usedthe 1,000 remaining samples as queries. We ran each
query 10 times andaveragedthe execution times from these
runs. All our experiments were conducted on a 168 MHz Ul-trasparc
station.
We investigatedthe following questions:
· How effective andpractical is our technique in classifying
shapes in a real data domain?
· How many Fourier coefficients shouldwe store in the index
? Storing larger number of coefficients reduces the
number of false positives but increases the index dimensionality
, andas a result the search time.
· How does our technique compare to sequential scanning?
4.1 Shape classification
To verify the effectiveness of our proposedtechnique in classifying
shapes, we triedto classify all 1,000 query shapes by
assigning every query shape to the class of its nearest neighbours
. When there was more than one nearest neighbours for
a shape, we pickedone randomly. The result was interesting:
96.4% of shapes were classifiedcorrectly. Some of those query
shapes are shown, in their gray scale andbinary representation
, in the two top rows of Fig. 4 along with their nearest
neighbours shown in the two bottom rows of the same figure.

As is shown, query shapes shown in Figs. 4a to 4h are classified
correctly with their Euclidean distances from their nearest
neighbours varying from 0 to 0.40. The query shape shown in
Fig. 4i is not classifiedcorrectly, but its binary representation
looks quite similar to that of its nearest neighbour. The
query shape shown in Fig. 4j looks different from its nearest
neighbour, though their boundaries still look similar.
In another experiment, we usedQuery 2 andtriedto identify
for each query shape its nearest neighbour irrespective
of a rotation factor
[-30

, 30

]. This did not change the
overall classification rate, i.e., only 96.4% of shapes were classifiedcorrectly
. However, allowing a rotation factor in general
did retrieve better matches. Figure 5 shows six query shapes
(in the top two rows), their original nearest neighbours (in
the middle two rows) and their optimal nearest neighbours (in
the bottom two rows) when the rotation factor variedfrom
-30

to
30

. As is shown, for example rotating the data shape
shown at the bottom of Fig. 5a by
11

in the ccw direction
reduces its Euclidean distance from the query shape to 0.30;
this is less than the Euclidean distance between the same query
shape andits original nearest neighbour. Table 1 summarizes
the effect of various rotations in correctly classifying shapes.
As is shown, applying a small rotation (
[-10, 10]) to d ata
shapes before matches slightly improves the classification rate
of hand-written digits; larger rotations, on the other hand, either
have no effect or deteriorate the rate of correct classifications
. This is because the digit data is generally sensitive
to orientations andallowing larger rotations can potentially
retrieve more non-identical digits.
We later picked1,000 shapes among those storedin the
database, applied to each shape a random rotation in the range
[-, ] andusedit as a query shape. We only specifiedthe

shape, only the shape itself was retrievedfrom the database.
4.2 Varying the cut-off frequency
The effectiveness of the index mainly depends on the concentration
of the key shape information within a few descriptors
of fingerprints. To measure this effectiveness, we ran some
experiments varying the number of Fourier descriptors stored
in a fingerprint. Figure 6 shows the ratio of query shapes that
are classifiedcorrectly (according to the criteria outlinedin
Sect. 4.1) to all query shapes varying the number of Fourier
amplitudes used for classification. As the number of amplitudes
increases up to 6, the ratio of shapes that are classified
correctly increases accordingly up to 0.778. This ratio remains
the same despite increasing the number of Fourier amplitudes
from 6 to 10. Comparedto a full shape description which consists
of both the amplitudes and the phases of 30 lower Fourier
coefficients, classifying 96.4% of the shapes correctly, a fingerprint
does a pretty good job using only 6 amplitudes which
make up only 10% of a full shape description and still classifying
0.778% of the shapes correctly.
Figure 7a shows the average execution time of Algorithm 1
for 1,000 nearest-neighbours queries, broken into: (1) search
time in Step 1 to identify the initial approximate nearest neighbours
; and(2) search time in Step 3 to findthe real nearest
neighbours. Figure 7b shows the fraction of index nodes accessed
, averaged over 1,000 nearest-neighbours queries, again
broken into the fractions accessedin Step 1 andStep 3.
As the number of Fourier amplitudes increases, the index
selectivity improves, i.e., the index gives fewer false hits. The
number of false hits, as is depicted in Fig. 8 for a proximity
query, mainly depends on the number of Fourier amplitudes
usedin fingerprints andthe output size of the query. Due to
the high similarity between different shapes of the same digit,
a large fraction of our false hits (for example, 62% when the
output size was 11 andthe number of Fourier amplitudes was
6) were other shapes of the same digit depicted by the query
shape which were not within the specifieddistance of the query
shape.
The reduction in false hits reduces the search time since
less time is needed to remove those false hits. However, increasing
the number of Fourier amplitudes after some point,
often calledthe cut-off frequency, either does not reduce the
number of false hits or reduces it only slightly. This is because
higher frequency amplitudes carry less of the energy
than lower frequency ones. On the other hand, the search time
increases with the index dimensionality, because the tree becomes
deeper. Furthermore, the pruning becomes harder, as
is shown in Fig. 7 with the ratio of index nodes that are accessed
, because the probability of an arbitrary data bounding
rectangle being close to the query point increases with the
dimensionality.
Given the trade-off between the tree search time and the
time spent for removing false hits, it is natural to expect that
there is an optimal cut-off frequency. Basedon our experiments
, as illustratedin Figs. 6 and7, the optimal cut-off frequency
occurs for as few as 6 Fourier amplitudes.
4.3 Comparison to sequential scanning
Figure 9 shows the average execution time of our proposed
methodcomparedto sequential scanning for 1,000 nearest-neighbours
queries. To get its best performance, we used
bufferedinput for sequential scanning, in a system with buffer
size of 8,192 bytes. For the experiment shown in Fig. 9a, the
border length was fixed to 30 while the database size variedfrom
10,000 to 30,000 shapes. Since the size of dataset
was limited, we doubled or tripled the size by adding one or
two randomly rotated copies of each shape to the database.
This doubling did not affect the performance of sequential
scanning, which was linear in the input size, but we expected
the doubling to deteriorate the performance of our method
since high similarity among database shapes would increase
the number of false hits. For the experiment shown in Fig. 9b,
the number of shapes was fixedat 10,000 while the number of
Fourier descriptors used to represent a boundary varied from

<SECTION header="Conclusions">We have proposedan indexing technique that can efficiently
retrieve images of objects basedon similarity between their
boundary shapes. We have used Fourier descriptors as our
shape features andhave developedan index organization such
that similar shapes can be easily retrievedirrespective of their
differences in size, position and orientation. The highlight of
our contribution is an index structure that helps find optimal
matches between shapes irrespective of various differences between
them. Our technique has the following desirable properties
:
· It uses a shape matching mechanism which is well-studied
in the area of pattern recognition.
· It exploits the fact that important features of a large class
of shapes are concentratedwithin only a few Fourier descriptors
.
· It can handle shapes of various sizes.
· It guarantees efficient retrieval of all qualifying shapes.
Furthermore, we have presenteda refinement of an earlier
nearest-neighbours search algorithm for feature vectors that
are truncated, due to the significance of some features over
others, before being storedin a R-tree index.
